            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>And now, Sir, at a time when from all Parts of the Nation, Your Loyal People are contending how to expreſs their Gratitude, both to Heaven
<pb facs="tcp:95495:3"/>and You, for the Benignity of Your Reign, and the manifold Bleſſings they enjoy under ſo Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a Prince; I hope it will not misbecome me to make Your Majeſty this moſt Humble Oblation of my Duty, which proceeds from a Heart full of Reverence and Obedience for You, and poſſeſt with a deep ſenſe of the Honour and good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune I have to be born Your Subject.</p>
            <p>All, Sir, I preſume to preſent You with, are ſome Obſervations which I made in my Travels into <hi>Greece;</hi> a Country once Miſtreſs of the Civil World, and a moſt Famous Nurſery both of Armes and Sciences; but now a Lamentable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Inſtability of humane things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Your Majeſties Diſcontented and Factious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, if their own late Calamities will not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently inſtruct them, may ſee the Miſeries that other Nations are reduced to, and behold, as in a Picture, the Natural Fruits of Schiſm, Rebellion and Civil Diſcord.</p>
            <p>When I conſider the deplorable Condition of that once Glorious Nation, I cannot but adore the mercy of God to our own; who is pleaſed to let us enjoy ſuch Priviledges under Your Majeſty, in a State governed by Laws, and in a Church purified from Errour and Superſtition.</p>
            <p>Indeed, Sir, Nothing is wanting to compleat our Happineſs, but that it would pleaſe Almighty God to continue it, in giving Your Majeſty a Long and Proſperous Reign; and when it ſhall pleaſe him to tranſlate You from this tranſitory to an Immortal Crown, to perpetuate Your Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb facs="tcp:95495:3"/>in Your Royal Family, as the Prudence of our Anceſtors, and the Politick Laws of this Ancient Monarchy have eſtabliſhed it; that we may have no more Mock-Governments, nor loſe our Religion and Liberty, as we lately did, under a pretence of better ſecuring them.</p>
            <p>As this is the deſire, Sir, of all good Engliſh Men, ſo I humbly conceive it is proper, eſpecially in ſuch a Conjuncture as this, for every Man to own it; which muſt be my excuſe at this time for approaching Your Majeſty, as I do, and for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of this occaſion of expreſſing my ſelf with moſt profound Humility</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE</head>
            <p>IT is uſual for thoſe that publiſh their Writings, to give the World ſome account of them, by way of Preface; which is a cuſtom, I have no reaſon to neglect, ſince I find my ſelf obliged, not only to make an Apology, for putting forth this Diſcourſe, but alſo for many things contained therein. I have reaſon, I ſay, to let the World know, what prevailed upon me, to expoſe both it and my ſelf thereby to publick cenſure, in an Age of ſuch Wit and Learning as this. For I am not ignorant of thoſe ingenious men, who have already obliged our Nation and the World, by their Writings on great part of this ſubject, aided by parts and learning far excelling any thing I can pretend to. But I alſo as well as they, having by Gods aſſistance, had a proſperous Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, into thoſe parts of the World, and made a conſiderable Collection of uſeful Obſervations, and other Curioſities, began to think, that both my time and labour ſpent thereon, would ſoon be inevitably loſt, ſhould I not take care to put them into ſome convenient method for their preſervation. And really when I conſidered the many and eminent dangers and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties I had by Gods wonderful Providence been delivered from; the many Obligations and ſignal Honours I received from ſeveral illuſtrious Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and generous Friends both at home and abroad; with the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Peace, Freedom and Tranquillity, I was returned to, and we of theſe Countries enjoy, above any Nation in the World: I concluded it would misbecome me, to bury ſuch Bleſſings in Oblivion, without erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leaſt Monument of Gratitude in remembrance of them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore enjoying ſome leiſure in the Country ſolitudes, I choſe to retire unto, after my return, I made This and my Books my divertiſement; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing then only, to ſet my Obſervations in ſuch an uſeful order, as might
<pb facs="tcp:95495:5"/>preſerve them the better in my Memory: or at moſt, upon occaſion, to entertain ſuch of my friends with them, as were curious to know how I had employed my time in thoſe parts; being conſcious that my unpoliſhed ſtyle, and manner of writing, would be unfit to appear in publick, were the matter contained therein never ſo deſerving.</p>
            <p>But whileſt I entertained my ſelf with theſe thoughts, Monſieur <hi>Spon,</hi> my Fellow Traveller, ſent me over an account of our Voyage, which he with much Ingenuity and Learning had compiled, and Printed in French; wherein, he did me the Honour of placing my name with his in the Title, and for the moſt part throughout the Book. This with great ſatisfaction I read over; yet it did not ſo entirely anſwer my deſign as to make me deſiſt from the purpoſe I had before entred upon, although it much furthered me in the performance of it.</p>
            <p>Thus between his Book, and my own Papers, I with much ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction diverted my ſelf that Summer, which was <hi>1678.</hi> fanſying my ſelf again in the enjoyment of that happy time I ſpent in thoſe parts, and his ingenious Converſation. But when I had brought my deſign well near to a period, I heard, at my return to <hi>London,</hi> the following Winter, that ſomebody was about to tranſlate Monſieur <hi>Spon</hi>'s Book into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and to print it.</p>
            <p>Hereupon I thought my ſelf concerned to find out the truth, and not to permit any thing to come out in Engliſh with my name, which was not in all points agreeable to my own ſentiments. Which being a thing ſcarce poſſible in ſuch variety of matter, without a joint conſultation, I thought it better to publiſh my own ſence in my own words, than to ſuffer his words and particular ſence to paſs in my name. And in ſhort, comparing notes, I found I had many uſeful Obſervations omitted by him, which I thought very fit to be communicated to the curious among the reſt of our Remarks, to make the account going under both our names, as much the Relation of both as I could.</p>
            <p>As to the matter contained in this Book, I find no reaſon I have to be aſhamed of it, although I do not expect it ſhould eſcape cenſure. For I know ſome will ſay, why does he treat us with inſipid deſcriptions of Weeds, and make us hobble after him over broken ſtones, decayed buildings, and old rubbiſh? But theſe being things their curioſity does not extend to, I ſhould but trifle, in giving them a ſerious Anſwer. Others, perhaps, may not be pleaſed, that I have made Divine Reflections on the various events of things, and Phaenomena of nature. As to men of this irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious temper, I make no other anſwer, but that I deſign'd to write as a Chriſtian Traveller and Philoſopher; and if my Book be unacceptable to
<pb facs="tcp:95495:5"/>them, becauſe it ſavours of my Religion, they may leave it, as they do their Bibles, to others, who will like it better upon that account.</p>
            <p>As to the Title, not only Gratitude but Juſtice alſo requires that I ſhould join Monſieur <hi>Spon</hi>'s name with mine, ſince he did me the ſame reſpect in his, and we made the Voyage together. And in compoſing this Treatiſe, I have all along had an Eye to his, ſtill comparing my notes with his, having for the greateſt part ſeen the ſame things which he did.</p>
            <p>What I find Monſieur <hi>Spon</hi> hath omitted, I have ſupplied; and on the other ſide, what material things I found I had neglected in my own Journal, I added out of his Book, if I well remembred them. When I met with any things to be miſtakes, I have as freely corrected them, and in dubious Criticiſms I have given my own Opinion and Reaſon.</p>
            <p>The Obſervations which I made, and are not to be met with in Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Spon,</hi> are various and ſcattered throughout the whole Book: But the chiefeſt are, firſt the Plants I have deſcribed, on which ſubject he hath not at all concerned himſelf. My Map of <hi>Achaia</hi> alſo I have added, which I made out of my own particular Obſervations, I took on the places, for that purpoſe. Divers Medals and other Antiquities I have by me, ſince ſent from <hi>Athens</hi> to me, and obſerved after we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from each other, as they lay in my method, and made for my purpoſe, I have inſerted in this account.</p>
            <p>As to the curious Plants I would have added more Cuts, moſt of them which I have deſcribed, being either unknown or very rare in our parts; but indeed the Bookſeller was very unwilling to be burthened with them, the change of Graving being too great for his profit.</p>
            <p>The Map of <hi>Achaia,</hi> I have ſpoken of, may need ſome things to be ſaid in its behalf, ſince the Poſition of the whole Scheme of it, is ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from all the Maps of thoſe parts we have extant; to anſwer for which I will give an account of my Delineation of it, being a way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps unuſual in deſcribing of Land-Maps. The Obſervations I had made, being taken by the help of a Mariners Needle, from ſeveral ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on divers Mountains and eminent places of that Country, I thereby eaſily reduced their Poſitions into Triangles; and thereby could hardly miſs of their natural ſituations, nor yet to have a proportionable diſtance from one another, according to a ſcale of parts propoſed, from any one or two ſeveral known diſtances. Which though it be but an ordinary rule in ſurveighing, yet in thoſe Countries, where from a Mountain, one may ſee twenty, thirty, forty, and fifty miles about, it may prove of more uſe and certainty than all the reſt of the Geographical Art of Longitudes in
<pb facs="tcp:95495:6"/>the World. To this I had alſo the advantage of the Latitudes, <hi>Mr. Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> had with all exactneſs taken, of the moſt eminent places contained therein, as of <hi>Patras, Delphus, Thebes, Chalcis</hi> or <hi>Egripo, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> and <hi>Athens.</hi> By adding which to the Obſervations made with the Needle, I found I could not miſs of much more exactneſs than ever could yet be arrived at, by conjectural Longitudes, whether of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient or modern Geographers. For the Bearing of two places of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Latitudes being given, one cannot miſs of a proportionable diſtance, according to the ſcale of Latitude; if from the one you follow the Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Latitude of the other. For there is but one individual point on a Plane, that can be the ſame Latitude, and the ſame Bearing from another Latitude. As for Example, <hi>Thebes</hi> is <hi>38. D. 22. M. L. Chalcis</hi> is <hi>38. D. 31. M. L.</hi> So there is nine Minutes difference in Latitude. But the Bearing from <hi>Chalcis</hi> to <hi>Thebes</hi> is <hi>W. S. W.</hi> So a Scale of Latitudes being deſcribed by Parallel Lines, and <hi>Chalcis</hi> being placed thereon in <hi>38. D. 31. M. L.</hi> Draw a Line thence directly <hi>W. S. W.</hi> and whereſoever it cuts the line of Latitude <hi>38. D. 22. M.</hi> there muſt be the point where <hi>Thebes</hi> muſt be ſituate. For any other point or diſtance but that, alters either the Latitude or Bearing, againſt the Hypotheſis. When I had thus ſet down the places of principal note, eſpecially thoſe Cities, with the Mountains, Rivers, Promontories, and Harbours; the other places according to their Bearings, and reputed diſtances of Miles from the firſt, I regulated as well as I could. Which ſo near as their reputed diſtances come to the truth, ſo near muſt they be to the true Latitudes: For this Rule ſerves both ways. If you have the true Latitudes and the Bearings, you have the true ſituation; ſo if you have the true Latitude of one place, and the true Bearings and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances thence to the places adjacent, you have alſo the true Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.</p>
            <p>This Rule if it were well improved, might produce Maps more exact than any we have yet had, and make the much deſired Longitude leſs valuable in Geography. For this would give a true proportionable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from place to place, which is the thing ſo much pretended to by Longitudes; but is more by chance, than Science, at any time, if ever, arrived to.</p>
            <p>That this is practicable to particular Places and Countries, I have given a proof; and how it may be applicable to the general Geography of the World, I will propoſe in two or three words, and leave it to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and conſidered by thoſe of better parts and more leiſure than my ſelf. Suppoſe then only that two points of Poſition or Bearing were
<pb facs="tcp:95495:6"/>added to the two points of Latitude on the Globe, and place them in two eminent places on the Equinoctial Line, or on one only till we can come to the knowledge of its oppoſite point, by more experience: Let this be the Center of a Circle divided into <hi>360.</hi> degrees, which will ſerve both for the degrees of Latitude and for the degrees of Bearing. From theſe Centers let Lines be drawn to every tenth degree, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the points of Bearing, and Parallel Lines to the Equator, from every tenth degree to tenth degree, to diſtinguiſh the Latitudes. And theſe are all the neceſſary Lines I can think on. As to the Colures, they will be of no further uſe; and the Tropicks, Ecliptick, Arctick and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarctick Circles, they appertain rather to the Celeſtial Globe than the Terreſtrial.</p>
            <p>Thus as the Equator divides the World into two equal parts of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern and Southern Latitude, ſo would this divide it into two equal parts of Bearing, Eaſtern and Weſtern. Thus the Lines of Bearing, cutting the Lines of Latitude, all things might be placed on the Globe with the greateſt eaſe imaginable, from the beſt and correcteſt Charts, Maps, and Obſervations of Travellers, either on the Globe or a Plain. Thus in time by diligence and correct Obſervations, the defects of the ſuppoſed Longitude would be taken away; and Tables of Bearing cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly collected and ordered in their ſtead: and the various contractions of the degrees of Longitude, according to the diſtance of the Parallels from the Equator, would likewiſe be taken away. Which is another incurable defect in the ſuppoſititious degrees of Longitude. For thus all the Circles would be equal, cutting the Globe into equal parts.</p>
            <p>But to return to my Map of <hi>Achaia,</hi> I have inſcribed the ancient names of the Provinces, Mountains, Rivers, Promontories, Ports and Bayes; but of the Towns only the preſent names; for had I had always room to do it, it would only have bred a confuſion between them. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan indeed with <hi>Attica</hi> inſtead of the ancient names to mark them with Figures referring to a Catalogue of them; but finding it too tedious a work ſuddenly to go through with, I proceeded no further, but left it to another opportunity, to finiſh a Geographical Diſcourſe of thoſe parts, eſpecially <hi>Attica,</hi> I long ſince began and deſigned in Latine; wherein I ſhall explain my Marble of the Tribes by giving an account of their diviſion into <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Borough-Towns.</p>
            <p>At preſent I have contented my ſelf with making a Catalogue of thoſe Obſervations I have, and placing it at the bottom of the Map, adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it alſo about the margent with ſuch figures of the principal places as I thought proper, thereby to make it an Ornament for a Study as well as
<pb facs="tcp:95495:7"/>to this Book. And this is the reaſon you will find ſome of the titles of the Figures in Latine and ſome in Engliſh, which miſſed my obſervation before they were printed off, otherwiſe they might have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered again.</p>
            <p>There are other faults I find, ſome whereof are my own, and ſome the Printers. Thoſe of the Printers moſt of them are happened I ſuppoſe, by reaſon of my diſtance from the Preſs, living in the Country; and for them I muſt refer you to the <hi>Errata.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for thoſe of my own, I have obſerved ſince the Printing, they are</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Page 12.</hi> That a <hi>Seſtertium</hi> or <hi>Seſtertius</hi> is a piece of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney weighing about two pence half peny, in which it ſeems I trusted too much to my memory; for it weighs but two pence, as I weighed one I have, by two pence of our new mill'd money. But by Mr. <hi>Greaves</hi> his account of the Roman <hi>Denarius</hi> it ſhould not be quite ſo much; for he makes a <hi>Denarius,</hi> of which this is the fourth part, to weigh but ſeven pence half peny farthing; however conſidering the fineneſs of the ſilver, in reſpect to the alloy of our Standard, we may well reckon it worth two pence, if not more. So that the whole coſt was about five pounds five ſhillings of our money; by which may be judged the decreaſe of the value of ſilver ſince thoſe dayes.</p>
            <p>In the Figure of <hi>Zara, Page 8.</hi> the Baſtions of the Walls of the Town ought to be round as I have deſcribed them, although I find in the Figure, both he that deſigned it from my Scetch, and the Engraver af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, have made them ſquare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page 32.2. The Soil of Corfu,</hi> &amp;c. to <hi>Vel hirſuto,</hi> is a tranſpoſition, and ought to follow after <hi>Wife and all. Page 34.</hi> Which is the fault of the Copyiſt I made uſe of, not obſerving the marks of interpoſition I gave him on my foul Copy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page 405.</hi> Speaking of the Images of <hi>Ceres,</hi> I have by me, I have ſaid, <hi>ſhe holdeth ſomething round in her other hand;</hi> which, out of St. <hi>Aug. de Civitate Dei, Lib. 7. c. 24.</hi> I have ſince ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be a kind of Hand-Drum, he calls <hi>Tympanum,</hi> being an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument they uſed to ſound before her, as the Mother of the Gods. Under which name the Heathens did comprehend not only the <hi>Phrygian Cybele,</hi> but alſo <hi>Ceres, Proſerpina, Veſta,</hi> and ſeveral others of the Goddeſſes. <hi>Aug. Lib. 7. c. 15.</hi> And as the Mother of the Gods, undoubtedly the Athenians took their
ΔΗΜΗΤΗΡ:
as appears, by all thoſe marks of the Lyons, the <hi>tympanum,</hi> and the ſacrificing Plate; only the Basket of Fruit on her Head, inſtead of the Towered Crown, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſht her more peculiarly to be <hi>Ceres.</hi> I have two <hi>Baſſo-Relievos</hi> I
<pb facs="tcp:95495:7"/>deſigned at <hi>Rome,</hi> which exactly agree with the deſcription St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> gives of the Mother of the Gods, which would be here too long to inſiſt upon.</p>
            <p>In reading over this Book I obſerve that ſeveral of the Medals de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed therein, and cut on the Plates, have no reference marked in the Margent to find them as I ordered; therefore thoſe that are curious to ſee them, may turn to the Plates and find them in their order.</p>
            <p>I muſt tell you alſo that the account I have given you of the meaſures of things muſt be underſtood of the French foot which only I had by me, and is half an inch bigger than the Engliſh.</p>
            <p>Theſe are what I obſerved, and hope are the moſt conſiderable faults of this Book; what others have ſlipped by my notice, muſt be ſupported by thoſe that will read this Treatiſe, and conſidered as Badges of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, whoſe limited and frail nature is ſuch, that it cannot be wiſe in all things; no more than were it ſo, it can be wiſe to all men. I am ſure there is nothing in it ſo ill but it was meant well, therefore if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what is well or ill meet with a candid conſtruction, I ſhall neither think my time miſpent that I employed thus, to divert my ſelf in writing it, nor ill beſtowed on thoſe that ſhall reap any benefit or ſatisfaction by the publiſhing of it.</p>

            <p>The moſt ſerene Republic of Venice, as they are ſtiled, is the ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Free-State that now flouriſheth in the World; and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the great loſſes they have ſuſtained from the innumerable Armies of the Turks, have yet ſuch large and fruitful Territories, as make them the objects of the Envy and Jealouſie, not only of the Grand Signior, but alſo of moſt of the Chriſtian Princes, their Neighbours.</p>
            <p>Their Hiſtorians calculate their beginning from the fifth Century, about which time the Goths, Huns, and Vandals enter'd into Italy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying and ſacking great part of the chief Cities of it; among which was Altinum, ſituated at the bottom of the Gulph Northwards from Venice, the Ruines whereof retain ſtill the name of Altino, which was (as they ſay) deſtroyed by Attila. From this Altinum, Aquileia, and other Neighbouring Cities, ſuch as could eſcape the ſury of Attila, fled to theſe little Iſlands, where now Venice ſtandeth. Thus did they unen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied, and unſuſpected, in the laſt extremity of Fortune, lay the firſt Foundations of one of the nobleſt, richeſt, and ſecureſt Cities in the World. And although in ſeveral Ages after, their encreaſe was not full ſo conſiderable, as to be feared or envied, yet ſo ſoon as they began to be ſo, they ſtill defended themſelves with ſo great ſucceſs, as made their Neighbours content to be at Peace with them.</p>
            <p>Their firſt Victories were over Dalmatia and Iſtria, and after having conquered the Anconians, and others, at Sea, they rendered themſelves Maſters of the Adriatick Gulph. After this, they encreaſed ſo in Riches and Strength, that by the fifteenth Century they had render'd themſelves compleat Maſters of Friuli, Padua, Verona, Vicenza, Breſſia, Bergamo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with thoſe ample and moſt fruitful Territories about them. They had Romagnia under their protection, and Puglia their Feudatory, and at laſt became Maſters of the Morea, and the greateſt part of the Iſlands of the Archipelago, with Negropont, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of Cyprus and Candia; which laſt they defended bravely twenty three years, and at laſt parted with it with Honour, and it may be, with leſs prejudice to themſelves, than to the reſt of Chriſtendom.</p>
            <p>But now among the Iſlands of the Archipelago, they have only Cerigo and Tine; which, with Iſtria, and the Coaſts of Dalmatia, Corfu, Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia, and Zant, are all that remain of the Levant part of their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: All which Provinces, and Cities in them, are commanded by Governours, dignified with particular Titles, according to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and importance of the ſeveral places, as Generals, Proveditors, or Counts, who are choſen by the Senate, and enabled by their deputed Power to act and judge in all Cauſes; from whoſe Sentence no Appeal can be made, but only to the Senate of Venice. They are choſen out of the Families of the Nobles, and during their Government, are as Princes: But ſo ſoon as that is expired, they are reduced again to their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95495:15"/>firſt Principles of a private Life; which they return to with ſo much evenneſs of Temper, and ſo unconcern'd, as ſhews they knew how to Obey, before they were entruſted with Command.</p>
            <p>We had not ſtay'd above a Week at Padua, but News was brought us, that the Bailo was ready to part, which haſten'd us again to Venice; where, as ſoon as we were arriv'd, we found it ſo true, that we had but that day to prepare our ſelves for ſo great a Voyage, get Licenſe to Embark in one of the Gallies, and to order our Letters of Credit; which although they be neceſſary in ſo long a Journey, yet many things elſe are requiſite to one who intends to make the beſt advantage of his time in thoſe remote parts; eſpecially a good Sea-Compaſs, a Quadrant, or other Inſtrument to take Latitudes, and a meaſure of a Foot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But my haſt gave me not leaſure to get the ſecond; which when I ſaw the Errors of our modern and ancient Maps, I too late wiſh'd for.</p>
            <p>The <hi>20th</hi> of June I again return'd to Venice, went to Signior Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detto Sanudo, a noble Venetian, who was Captain of the Galley called <hi>Il Hercule in cunea,</hi> and one of the two that was appointed to carry and accompany the Ambaſſador. Of him, though with ſome difficulty, I obtain'd the favour of paſſage for my ſelf, and Monſieur Spon, on Board his Galley.</p>
            <p>About Midnight we ſet Sail from Venice, the Wind being fair, though ſo gentle a Gale, and the Water ſo ſmooth, that we hardly perceived we made way: Nevertheleſs by the next Morning we were in ſight of the ſhore of Iſtria, and about two hours before Noon we arrived at the Scoglio, or little Iſland of St. Andrè, on the ſame ſhore,<note place="margin">

            <p>It being determined, that we ſhould ſpend the reſt of the day here, and that Iſland affording but little other Entertainments, I went that Afternoon a Simpling; which was a Curioſity ſeldom failed to give me ſatisfaction, when all other Divertiſements were wanting. And truly this little Spot afforded me Entertainment of that nature beyond expectation: There I found,

            <p>Hard by this Iſland, upon the ſhore of Iſtria, is Ruigna, ſituated upon a little Peninſula, and inhabited altogether by Sea-men, who are moſt of them profeſs'd Pilots; and for their encouragement, all Ships, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Venetians or Strangers, are obliged to touch there, and to take a profeſs'd Pilot of this place, to Steer them over the Flats that are before the entrance into the Venetian Harbours, which are very difficult and dangerous. I heard the Pilot ſay, that conducted the Veſſel I return'd in, that it had ſometimes but half a Foot, and ſometimes not above an Inch of Water below its Keel. Ruigna hath a very good and ſecure Haven, and that by nature, without the help of Art. The Country about it is fruitful in excellent Wines and Oyl, which may be the reaſon that there are ſo many decrepit perſons there, ſtrong Wine being the producer of Gouts and Sciatica's. The Women wear Fardingals here, after the Spaniſh faſhion. The Town is not big, but ſeems populous, and is a Biſhop's ſee.</p>

            <p>Pola is one of the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cities of Iſtria,<note place="margin">Pola.</note> ſituated at the farther end of a little Bay, which makes a moſt ſecure and ſpacious Port, every way Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock'd: But thoſe that look upon the ſmall number of its Inhabitants at preſent, ſcarcely amounting to ſeven or eight Hundred, would hardly credit its former greatneſs, without ſuch eminent Marks of its An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, as ſtill remain. That it hath been a Free-State, or Commonwealth, we found upon the Pedeſtal of a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Emperour Severus, whereon is engraven the Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by <hi>Reſpublica Polenſis,</hi> or the Commonwealth of Pola. The marks of its greatneſs are its Amphitheater, Triumphant-Arch, and Temple, dedicated to Rome and Auguſtus Caeſar. Authors agree not concerning its firſt beginning. The Poet, Callimachus, affirms it was a Colony of Cholcis, who purſued the Argonauts by Sea; whom ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt in the purſuit, and not daring to return to their King, they voluntarily baniſhed themſelves their Country, and planted this. Wherefore their City was called <hi>Pola;</hi> which ſignifieth (if we may believe Strabo) a baniſhed people. Nor can they agree what way they took to come to this place. Some will have it, that they came by the Euxin-Sea, up the Danube, formerly called Iſter; which made them give the name of Iſtria to the Country they came to inhabit; and that they afterwards ſail'd in the Adriatick-Sea with the ſame Veſſels: a thing impoſſible, unleſs they carried them upon their ſhoulders; the Danube having no communication with the Venetian-Gulph. Yet that they were a Colony of ſome of the Graecians, may be concluded from their main money ſtill coyned with the name of their Country in Greek Letters; of which I have ſeen ſeveral, but eſpecially one of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted antiquity in the curious Collection of the Earl of <hi>Peterbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi> &amp;c. which hath ſtamped on the one ſide two young faces, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed to each other; and on the other an Eagle preying on a Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin, with theſe Letters circumſcrib'd

               <hi>To Rome and Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> as before ſaid. There is alſo the ruins of another hard by: and the Dome, or Cathedral Church ſeemeth to be built upon another, by the ruins about it, and ancient Stones compiled in the building. The Font for holy Water hath been an ancient Fountain of white Marble four ſquare. At each ſide the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter flowed over, and made a pretty Caſcade, deſcending by ſeveral degrees; firſt running over Nimphs on the two oppoſite ſides, and two Scallop-ſhells on the other two oppoſite. The Triumphal-Arch was built in honour of one <hi>Caius Sergius,</hi> by his Wife <hi>Salvia Poſthuma,</hi> and was adorned with his, and others of the Families Statues, as may be judged by the form of it. It is of the Corinthian-order, of White Marble: But is now become only the Eaſt-gate to the Town, though formerly one of the Principal Ornaments thereof. The Amphithea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is without the Town northwards, and wants much of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, either of that of Rome, or that of Verona. It is of the Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can-order, and is judged to have had no other ſeats within, than of wood. Beſide theſe we found ſome Sepulchral-Monuments of leſſer note; which if they be thought worth it, I ſhall make publick here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. It hath a Cittadel upon a Rock within the Walls, but inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable for ſtrength. It hath plenty of Proviſions, and good Water. The long ſlip of Rocks, South of it, though barren enough, is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſtored with many curious Plants. Theſe I obſerved: 1. <hi>Acacia Poetarum.</hi> 2. <hi>Criſta galli flore purpureo.</hi> 3. <hi>Trifolium Saxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, Hirſutiſſimum.</hi> 4. <hi>Geniſta Montana Arboreſcens.</hi> 5. <hi>Polygala re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiorum.</hi> 6. <hi>Leucoium Patavinum.</hi> 7. <hi>Pentaphyllon incanum;</hi> that which Gerard gives for this, hath but three leaves; but this hath five. 8. <hi>Cordilium Creticum.</hi> 9. <hi>Secoridaca flore albo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>On Saint John Baptiſt's day, in the morning, we tried to get out of the Harbour; but the Wind being contrary, and higher than we thought, while we were in that calm Port, we were forced to return to a little creek at the mouth, juſt within the Promontory of the Southern-Harbour, and there ſtay till after Dinner. In which time I went, and climed up a Mountainous Rock hard by; where I found many other curious Plants. 1. <hi>Sage</hi> growing wild. 2. <hi>Tragoriga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Creticum,</hi> as ſome will have it; but I eſteem it <hi>Satureia,</hi> or what we call in our Kitchins, <hi>Winter-Savoury;</hi> and that from the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of ſmell, and ſubſtance of the leaves; which are not ſo thick and oyly as <hi>Tragoriganum;</hi> as likewiſe <hi>Polium, Roris marini foliis,</hi> or leaves like Roſe-mary.</p>
            <p>After Dinner we put out to Sea, but not without danger; the Wind continuing ſtill high, and contrary. After we had made ſix miles, (which is the length of the Bay, which makes the Haven of Pola) a ſtorm beginning to riſe, we put in between the point, and the Iſland Veruda; which with the Land, and ſome other ſuch Scoglio's about it, make a good harbour. Here the Holy Virgin is worſhipped with great Devotion, by the name of <hi>Madonna di Veruda;</hi> Her Church, with the Convent, belongeth to the Minime-Fryers.</p>
            <p>The next day early we parted hence, to paſs a dangerous Gulph, called the <hi>Quarner,</hi> Thirty miles over. It hath at the bottom to the North the Mountain, <hi>Caldiera,</hi> which often ſends forth ſuch guſts of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95495:17"/>Wind, as are fatal to the Veſſels that muſt paſs it. Its high ridges look a far off, like an overgrown Cammel, with a great bunch upon the back. When we had paſſed about Twenty miles of the Thirty, and had about Ten to the Mountains of Oſſero, we ſaw a great ſtorm purſuing of us, which overtook us about four miles from Shore; but with ſuch fury, as made us immediately ſtrike Sail; it being an Hurricano, or Whirl-wind, that had almoſt overſet the Gally, before we could furl the Sails. It was accompanied with ſuch Thundring, Lightning and Rain, as if the Elements had conſpired to our deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The Sea alſo ran ſo high, that we could neither Sail, nor Row; yet by Gods mercy, and the help of the Rudder, we were droven after an hours time (although we could no way ſee the Land) under the Mountains of Oſſero, and thence we rowed into <hi>Porto-longo;</hi> which is on the North ſide of the Iſle Unia. In this Iſle there is but one Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, encompaſſed with a fertile ſoil, containing in all about nine, or ten miles in circuit, abounding in Corn and Wine; but the reſt very rocky and barren. Of Plants here are abundance, ſuch as I before named, and over and above a <hi>Syderitis Anguſtifolia, flore albo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day we endeavoured to get out to Sea; but finding the water too rough, we turned into <hi>Porto-novo,</hi> which is a little creek between the Mountains of Oſſero. After noon, the weather proving better, we ſet ſail, and paſſed between many little Iſlands (which along thoſe Coaſts are numberleſs) as Canigula and Sanſio South of us, in the Gulph Quarnerette: which towards the Land hath the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Morlaca: Towards the Eaſt San-Pietro in Limbo, being two little Iſles, thorough which we paſſed, making a good Harbour with a little Fort at the Eaſt-end of the moſt Northern of them.</p>
            <p>Hence we left Selva, with a pretty Town upon it, to the South: Oppoſite to which is L' Ulba; which hath North-Port Saint Nicola at one end, without any Town there; but hath one about three miles diſtant. Here groweth abundance of Samphire: of which the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners gathered great quantity to boil, and eat with Oyl and Vinegar. Here I found a Plant with a Bulbous-root, which ſent out a ſtalk about half a foot high, with a creſt, or crown of little ſmall flowers, ſtriped with white and Cinnamon-colour. I ſhould have taken it for a Moly, but that it had no ſmell: and for an Aſphodil, had I found any leaves at the root. Another like Samphire, but that each leaf ended with a Pricket.</p>
            <p>The next day we paſſed by many Rocks, lying in a row, South of us; as Melada, on which is a Town called Ceſtron. Then Rap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Harbour is on the North-ſide, and is well ſecured by the City; which ſerves inſtead of a Mole, to defend it from the South-winds; there being no other, that annoy it from the adjoyning Land. It lieth in length Eaſt and Weſt. The entrance of the Port is Weſt; where it hath two round Baſtions, with Cannon mounted on them: which ſaluted our Bailo, as alſo did the Musketteers from the Walls; and upon his arrival in the Port, the Count and Captain of the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary-forces received him at his Landing. They were cloathed in crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Suits and Gowns, made ſomething like the Civilians Gowns at Oxon. The Bailo alſo was in a crimſon ſute, but made after the French faſhion. Theſe, with the Militia, conducted him to the Palace of the General of Dalmatia, who reſides there. The Eaſt-ſide hath three Baſtions, and is defended by a ſtrong Cittadel, whoſe Fortification ſhews it had a good contriver, and a great deal of induſtry to bring it to that perfection. Its Foſſes are hewed out of the hard Rocks; which is the ſubſtance of the greateſt part of the ground thereabouts, and renders it very difficult to be mined. Its Baſtions, Half-moons, and Counterſcarps are well countermined, and mantled with hewen ſtone. The end of the Town, next the Cittadel, hath three regular Baſtions, and is ſeparate from it by a deep Foſſe. There is no Hill near it, to command it from without: So that it may paſs for a ſtrong Town; as it is alſo the chief of Dalmatia. The Military-Forces then conſiſted of eight Companies of Foot, and three of Horſe, being for moſt part Morlachs, Croats, and other People of the Mountainous and

They are inveterate enemies to the Turks, and never ſpare any of them, when they fall into their clutches. Whenſoever they make Parties to go pillage the Turks on their Borders, ſtill they return loaden with Booty. We were by many credible perſons aſſured, that ſuch was their ſtrength, as four of them would take a man on horſe-back upon their ſhoulders, and carry them both over the Streights and dangerous places of the Mountains, even ſometimes twenty, or thirty paces at a time; which hath been tried, when ſome of their chief Officers have been to paſs thoſe Mountains.</p>

It hath a glaſs on one ſide of its Shrine, to expoſe it to the view of the devout, and yet to keep it from the injury of weather. It appears of a whitiſh colour, much like to thoſe I have ſeen at Tholouſe in France, at the Church of the Cordeliers; where all the Bodies buried there, in the ſpace of one year, become as dry as any Mummy, and of a whitiſh colour. The moiſt parts being dried, the Skin, Nerves, and Muſcles only return; and when preſſed with the finger, return again.

            <p>Near the Greek Church, dedicated to Saint Helie, are two Corinthian Pillars, whoſe firſt Chapters and Baſes, are of very good Work. It is judged to be the Reſts of a Temple dedicated to Juno, from an Inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption taken hence, and made part of the Foundation of the Cupulo of Saint Donatus his Church by the Dome. The whole ſence may be made out by the beginning and ending of two Inſcriptions, which were formerly one Stone, by their ſhapes, but written on two ſides. For one line is repeated twice.</p>

            <p>The North-gate, Saint Chryſogono, by the Harbour, is part of an Arch, brought (as ſome of the Town yet remember) from about a mile off. Whence it is evident, the City was much larger formerly, than now it is. The Inſcription ſhews, that it was built by <hi>Melia Aniana</hi> to the memory of her Husband, <hi>Lupicius Baſſus,</hi> and that it was in a Market-place, and adorned with Statues, and coſt Six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Thirty Seſtertia, which is a piece of money that weigheth about Two-pence halfpeny, and amounts to near Twelve pounds ſterling; which was a great deal of money in thoſe days. We heard there was a Theater, where now the Cittadel is; but deſtroyed, when that was fortify'd.</p>
            <p>About a mile, or two, out of Town we ſaw ſome Ruins running Northward, and we were informed, they were continued near Thirty miles. Signior <hi>Valerio Ponte,</hi> Archdeacon of this place, aſſured us, that near theſe Ruins was found an Inſcription of the Emperor Trajan; which made him believe he was the Donor of it. It was undoubtedly an Aqueduct, to ſupply the Town with Spring-water; whereof it is ſtill deſtitute; having none, but what comes from the Heavens, and is collected into Ciſterns under the ground, in ſeveral places of the City; as, near the Generals Palace by the middle Baſtion, at the Eaſt-end of the City, at the Weſt-end near the Gate, and in the Herb-Market. I know not well how theſe Ciſterns are made here; whether they are cut out of the Rock the Town ſtands upon, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95495:20"/>the Rock lies as deep as the Water of the Sea. But moſt likely they are made as at Venice; where it is very ſtrange, that they who lie ſo far into the Sea, having their ground ſoft and ſpungy, yet their Ciſterns preſerve water (without the leaſt brackiſhneſs) always ſweet, and as wholeſome as any in the world. Wherefore, I gueſs, it may not be ungrateful to the curious, to have an account of what I obſerved at Venice, concerning them.</p>
            <p>After they have dug the place as deep, and as wide, as will ſerve their purpoſe, they lay a good foundation, and pave it with Stone and Plaiſter of Paris, very well, laying a large Stone in the middle, or at ſuch place as they intend to draw the water out: Upon which is built a Cylinder, in form of our Wells, of Brick or Stone, laid upon one another without any Mortar or Cement. The Walls alſo being well Terraſſed, they bring a ſort of freſh, ſtiff, blewiſh-colour'd Clay from the Land; which they firſt lay about half a foot thick upon the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, beginning round from the Cylinder to the Walls: and then they begin to raiſe it a foot and half, or thereabouts. Then fill the whole Ciſtern with the beſt clear Sand they can find (which they fetch from Lido) near the City; and as they fill it with Sand up higher and higher, ſo they raiſe the Clay about the Walls until they come unto the top. After which they put freſh water all over the Sand, partly to make it ſettle; and therefore as it ſinks, they fill it up with more Sand, until it hath its due proportion; and partly to take away all ſaltneſs from the Sand, which is taken from the Sea-ſide. And therefore they ſtill draw it out of the Well as faſt as it ſinks into it, until they find no more ſaltneſs in it. After which they cover it with an Arch, leaving three, or four holes, or more, of a foot, or thereabouts, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, which they fill with ſpunges; and that is to hinder all dirt, that comes with the rain-water, from entring into the Ciſtern. Theſe holes they cover with a ſmall Iron Grate, or a Stone, pierced and bored thorough in ſeveral places, contriving the upper pavement over the Arch in ſuch ſort, that all the water that falls near the place, runs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly into the Ciſtern. This I learned of <hi>Signior Bartholomeo Morelli,</hi> Brother to a great and rich Banker of Venice; who, while I was at Venice, made one about his houſe for his convenience; which I ſaw, as I have related. This may be very uſeful to many Sea-Towns, which want good freſh water.</p>
            <p>The Count, or Governour of this place, is <hi>Signior Antonio Soderino,</hi> of a Noble Venetian Family, who, beſides his Eminent Quality, is a Perſon no leſs obliging, than ingenious, very curious in Medals; of which the number he hath is far leſs conſiderable, than the rarity, and neatneſs of the pieces. He hath travelled in all Parts of the Levant, where he collected the greateſt part of them. Some of which indeed are ſo curious, as not only exceeded our expectation, but gave us hopes, that in our Travels into thoſe Parts we might alſo find ſome worth the pains of collecting. We had a Letter of recommendation to him, to have the favour of ſeeing his Cabinet; upon which he received us with a great deal of obligingneſs, and ſhewed us, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many curious pieces, two Otho's of Braſs, one Greek, the other Latin; which in Monſieur Spon's judgment, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95495:21"/>ancient; and an Antoninus Pius; the Reverſe of which was Orpheus, playing on his Harp, with all ſorts of Animals about him, as charmed by his Muſick. Monſieur Spon ſpeaks of Five Otho's; but I obſerved but Two of them in my Journal, which are thoſe he hath cauſed to be engraven; and are theſe I give you.</p>
            <p>I ſhould abuſe the Obligation we received of him, to paſs it by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mentioning his Courteſie; which was ſo extraordinary. After he had taken a great deal of pains in ſhewing us his Cabinet, he with as great kindneſs obliged us to ſup with him; where he gave us a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Treat, and in the mean time, unknown to us, ſent for all our bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage from our lodging, where we ſhould have had but bad accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, the ſmall humber of ſtrangers, that paſs that way, giving but little encouragement to Inns, and obliged us to make uſe of a handſome Apartment he aſſigned for us in his Palace: At which we were much ſurprized, when we were to take our leaves of him that night. But his civility ſtop'd not here; for he engaged us to make his Palace our Inn, during our ſtay in that place; which was five days longer.</p>
            <p>July the firſt,<note place="margin">Zara Vechia.</note> the Wind being fair, and a brisk gale; we ſoon paſſed by Zara Vechia, or Old Zara, which is about Eighteen miles from the other. We ſailed between the Land and ſeveral little Iſlands, which make a Channel like to a River, deep enough for Gallies, but not for Ships of any burthen. The Inhabitants on both ſides make the beſt they can of a ſhallow, and rocky ſoil. The ſurface of the Earth (as I was informed) is covered with a ſcaly rock; which being pared off, and laid in heaps, there appears a moſt fruitful ſoil, which they plant with Olives and Vines, which bear good Muskadel-Wines, and in great plenty.</p>
            <p>In three hours time we came to Mortaro,<note place="margin">Mortaro.</note> Thirty miles from Zara. This Port is made between two Iſlands, lying together, with high, rocky Mountains round about. It is deep enough for great Ships, and hath a little Town of about 50 or 60 houſes, water'd with a Spring of good water. Here on the Rocks I found, 1. A Plant with leaves, like Althea for ſhape, but of a deep green, and ſmooth, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a ſtalk above a yard and a half high, full of Milk. The Flower I ſaw not, it not being yet blown. The Bailo's Doctor would perſwade me, that it was <hi>Tithymalus Aſperagoides,</hi> but I rather think it<note n="*" place="margin">Pinax Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hini, lib. 3. ſect. 1.</note>

            <p>The next day we parted hence,<note place="margin">Sabenigo.</note> and paſſed in ſight of Sabenigo, the ſtrongeſt City of Dalmatia belonging to the State of Venice. Its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants are eſteemed ſeven or eight thouſand Souls, and we could diſcern from the Gally by the help of a Perſpective-glaſs four Forts. Of which we were informed one near the Harbour, is called Saint Nicholas. The other is the Works that mantle the Town. The other two are upon too little Rocks near the Town, called the Baron, and Saint Andrew. The Dome is much praiſed by the Venetians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all of Marble, and the Architecture very good. There is a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95495:21"/>little Iſland, juſt againſt the Town, called the <hi>Iſola D'oro,</hi> the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Iſland, from its pleaſantneſs. From Zara it is counted Fifty miles to this place. Hence we parted, and ſaw Trau more Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. We paſſed by ſeveral Scoglio's Southward of us, as Saint Andrè, Buza, L'Iſſa, Girone, and Salta, which lie South of Spalato, where we arrived the ſecond of July.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Spalato, or as ſome call it Spalatro,<note place="margin">Spalato.</note> ſeemeth to be a corruption of the word Palatium. For the Town that now is here, was the Palace of the Emperour Diocleſian. Its ſituation is very remarkable; the Land whereon it ſtands being a Peninſula, joyned to the Firm Land of Dalmatia by an Iſthmus of about a mile over; where it is Walled in by a prodigious precipice of Mountains, ranged along thoſe Coaſts, thorough which it hath only one entrance into the Firm Land by a very narrow paſſage; which is defended by a Fort built upon a Rock juſt in the entrance, about eight miles Northward from the City. The Sea thus encompaſſing it, makes a very delightful proſpect from ſome little hills lying Weſtwards from the Town. I take this Peninſula to be about four miles Eaſt and Weſt; but it is eſteemed eight miles from Spalato to Cliſſa Northwards.</p>
            <p>The Town is ſituated on the South-coaſts at the bottom of a Bay, in the bending ſhape of a half-moon, which makes a deep Haven, and of good Anchoridge, but ſomewhat open to the South-winds. Yet Gallies, and ſmaller Veſſels have a Mole to ſecure them from thoſe dangers. This place is about four hundred miles from Venice. It hath a very pleaſing proſpect, entring the Haven; one ſide of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, now part of the Wall of the Town, firſt offering it ſelf to the view. For it hath a Gallery of ancient Windows, adorned with Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and Corniſhes between each of them, of the Dorick-Order; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95495:22"/>one at each end, which are larger, and of the Corinthian. This Palace is ſquare, and comprehends above two parts of three of the City; the reſt, being a little oblong, added to the Weſt-ſide, makes the whole oblong; but both one and the other are lately fortified, and encompaſſed by a Work of three Baſtions Northwards, and two ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in the ſame line with the Wall of the Palace, and the Old City fronting the Haven. There is another little Fort N. E. of the Town againſt Incurſions from the Mountains; and another upon the Eaſt-point of the Harbour. But this is only of Earth, and hath Five Baſtions. On the Weſt is a Hill unfortified, which commandeth the Town, and renders it very weak.</p>
            <p>On the right hand, within the Mole, is a large Lazarett, as the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians call a Peſt-houſe; which are frequent in all the Cities of Italy, and under the Venetian Dominions. They are principally for thoſe that come from any place ſuſpected of the Plague, eſpecially Turky, which is never free from it. And here new-comers ſtay forty days to clear themſelves; which they call doing Centumaccia, or Quaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, from ſo many days allotted, before they can have Prattick, or any Commerce with the City. But this ſerved inſtead of a Palace to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the Embaſſadour, and alſo for want of an Inn in the Town for a Lodging for us. It hath three Quadrangles, each leſs than the other. The Chamber we choſe was the beſt of half a dozen, at leaſt of one ſide of the third Quadrangle. I ſhould have been gladder, had we found nothing but the bare Walls, as my Comerade hath given an account. For we had both them, and the Floor, ſo furniſhed with Chinches, Fleas and Emmots, that I (who uſed ſtill to have the greateſt ſhare in ſuch Vermin) feared we ſhould be devour'd before we parted thence, notwithſtanding all we could invent to deſtroy them. This is a very commodious place for the Merchants, that come out of Turky in great Companies, which they call Caravans, both to lodg them and their Merchandize, which they unlade here, it being the chief Scale of Trade for Shipping of Goods from Turky to Venice. Our Beds were ſuch as we had made at Venice, to lye on in the Gally, being our length and breadth of courſe Ticking-Cloth, well quilted with Wool; which did us great ſervice afterwards in all our Voyage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Turky.</p>
            <p>We ſtaied at Spalato eleven days, which gave us time enough to ſurvey the place with more than ordinary diligence. But that which moſt employed our curioſity, was the Palace of Diocleſian; who, when the weight of the Empire ſeem'd uneaſie to him, choſe this place to retire to, near his native City Salona. It is built of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, well hew'n, and cemented together: the Figure is an Equila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral ſquare, each ſide containing two hundred paces in length, and the height that remains is above ſixty foot. It hath a ſquare Tower at each corner, and three Gates, and with Monſieur Spon favour no more; that ſide towards the Sea, having none according to the beſt of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance; nor have I noted any more, in the deſign I made of the Town, or in my Journal: The Gate, which entreth the Town from the Haven, being no part of the Palace: The other are placed in the middle of each ſide.</p>

            <p>That ſide toward the Haven hath forty-five Windows, adorned with as many Pillars of the Dorick-Order, with Freezes, Architraves and Baſes very well proportioned: Beſides at each end one far larger, and higher than the reſt, with Three Arches born up by Corinthian Pillars of Marble. The Windows of the other ſides are not ſet off with Pillars, but plain. The North-gate (which is towards Salona) was well adorned with Statues, as the Niches ſhew. The weaving together of the Stones of the Architrave of the great entrance of this Gate is very pretty. This was for Horſes and Carts to come in at. The two leſſer entrances, at each ſide of it, were for the people, on foot. I give you the Figure as well as I could take it. The Weſt-wall is, for the greateſt part, razed to the foundations; yet what remains of the Gate, aſſures me, that it was beautified with two Hexagon-Towers on each ſide; and hence examining likewiſe the other two, I judg'd, that they alſo might have been adorned in the ſame manner. Concerning the Weſt-Gate, there is a way ſtreight thorough ſeveral ruins, ſeeming apartments of the Palace, which leadeth to a Court about fifty foot long, and ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen wide, which I judge to have been the Center of the Palace, and equally diſtant from the Gates. This place, on the Eaſt, Weſt, and South-ſide, is almoſt encompaſſed with a Portico of Pillars of the Egyptian Granate-ſtone, or a Stone very like it; of which I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſaw a Rock in the Iſland Delos; and ſince that, great plenty at Milan, about their Churches; which they dig out of a Quarry near Lago Maior at the foot of the Alps. They are of the Corinthian Order, well proportioned, and their Capitals of white Marble. At the South-end is a round Temple, like the Pantheon at Rome, whoſe Frontiſpiece wanteth not the Beauty of the more ancient Roman Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95495:23"/>At the Eaſt-end is an Octogon-Temple, and oppoſite to it Weſtward a ſquare one. The Plane of all which I here give, with its Dimenſions, as I took them. The Octogon is now the Cathedral Church, dedicated to Saint Lucia. It is Eight ſquare within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, as I find it by the Dimenſions, and figure I exactly took of it. It hath on the outſide a Portic round it, Eight-ſquare alſo, whoſe curious - wrought Planches of Stone are ſupported by Twenty-four Corinthian-Pillars of the ſame Granate with the others. Each ſide of the Portick, is of Fourteen foot long, and each of the Temples Ten. The door four foot wide, and is aſcended to by ſeveral ſteps out of the Court. Within, it hath two ranges of Pillars, one over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which placed in the ſeveral Angles, do make eight below, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a Gallery; and as many above; four of which are Granate, and four of Porphiry; and all of the Corinthian Order. Under it is a Vault, whoſe round-arched roof makes the floor of the Temple, which likewiſe is Arched, and built ſo ſtrong, as if it were meant for Eternity. The round Temple hath a Frontiſpiece, being the breadth of the South-end of the Court, which is ſuſtained by four Granate-Pillars of the Corinthian-Order; the two on each ſide ſuſtain an Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trave, on which is built an high Arch over the door; whoſe two Lintel-Poſts, and Tranſome, are of three whole Stones, well wrought, but too high to be eaſily meaſured by me. Were they upon Salisbury-Plain, I doubt not, they would paſs for ſuch Stones, as we there won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at ſo much. Within this is the Rotundo, Arched all over for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, but now part of it is fallen to decay. The Four-ſquare Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, oppoſite to the Octogone, hath nothing of extraordinary; it receiveth light only by the door, and is now dedicated to Saint John Baptiſt; and here they Baptize the Children of the Town.</p>
            <p>There are many of theſe Pillars of Granate-Marble lying here and there about the Town; and I was informed, that thoſe who have told them, have numbred, together with thoſe that are ſtanding, a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty-four.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding our bad lodgings at night, we made a ſhift to ſpend the days with as much pleaſure as we could wiſh; ſome new curioſity, or other, ſtill preſenting it ſelf to us; beſides the great plenty the place affords of every thing that is good, made us eat and drink as well as the Cookery of a German Soldiers Wife (the only one we could find in the Town to do us that favour) could make us; and that at very reaſonable rates. For they pay not for Partridges above a groat, or five-pence apiece; for a Hare not much more, and Butchers meat not above a peny a pound. Here is plenty of little young Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſes, which they ſell very cheap, and eſteem good meat. But the Trouts that are caught in the little River running thorough. Salona are held exquiſite, and were famous in the time of the Emperour Diocleſian; who was ſo pleaſed with them, that he made a Channel from the River to his Palace, there to preſerve them. There is plenty of good Fruit here; the ſeaſon then yielded Cherries, Mulberries, Figs, and abundance of Apricots; but of the laſt, I never found any ſo fair, nor well-taſted as thoſe of England.</p>
            <p>We had time not only to ſee the Town, but the places circumjacent
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95495:23"/>alſo. The firſt excurſion that we made was to ſee Salona, four miles or thereabouts, Northward of the Town, and thence as many more to ſee Cliſſa, thorough a moſt pleaſant Country, full of Vines, Olives, Corn, Pomegranates, and other curious Plants.</p>
            <p>Salona ſeemeth to have been about ſeven or eight miles in circuit,<note place="margin">Salona.</note> although they report it to have been more. It is now only Ruins, and Fields of Corn, as famous as it was in times paſt, for making conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual War againſt the Romans. It was deſtroyed by Auguſtus Caeſar, among other Towns of Dalmatia, as Strabo affirmeth, but was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored by Tiberius Caeſar, and reduced to a Roman Colony, as a frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Stone in the Steeple of Spalatro proveth.</p>

Not far from the River are the Reſts of an Aqueduct, ranged towards Spala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro; perhaps the Channel, that conveigheth the Trouts, or water at leaſt, from the River to Diocleſians Palace. We paſſed over this River North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to go to Cliſſa, four miles from hence, by the way that was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently called Gabiniana, as we learned among ſeveral Inſcriptions that we found on the Steeple of the Dome at Spalatro, which was built out the Ruins of Salona. This way leads from Salona to Andetrium, and owes its being, as the Stone affirmeth, to the Munificence of Tiberius Caeſar.</p>

            <p>From hence we went to Cliſſa, which is ſuppoſed to be the ſtrong Caſtle Andretrium (<gap reason="foreign">

This Stone alſo proves it to have been called Andetrium, rather than Andretrion, or Andecrium, Stones being leſs ſubject to be altered, than Books; whoſe often copying may introduce faults, the firſt Authors were never guilty of.</p>
            <p>Cliſſa is a very ſtrong Fort,<note place="margin">Cliſſa.</note> and that more by Nature than Art. The ſituation is upon a long Rock, made in the faſhion of a Gally; of which the Governours Lodgings at the North-end are the Poupe: It ſtands juſt in the middle of the paſſage between the Mountains, whoſe height and precipices are ſuch, as leaveth no other entrance into the Inland-parts from the Peninſula, but this. And this is ſo narrow, that not a man, or horſe, can paſs by without the Licenſe of the Caſtle. It was taken from the Turks by the Venetians, under the Conduct of Signior Foſcolo, who was then Proveditor of Dalmatia; and that as much by an accident, as by the vigorous aſſaults that were made againſt it. For after a long and fruitleſs expectance of Succours, and their Proviſions failing, the Turks were frighted into a Capitulation, by a Granado, that fell upon the Moſque, whileſt they were at their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, and did ſuch miſchief as quite diſcouraged them from hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out any longer. They therefore ſurrendred on condition of free paſſage with bag and baggage; which although granted by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, yet was of little uſe to them. For the Morlachs, their invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate enemies way-laid them in their paſſage, and cut all their throats, without his knowledge. It was aſſaulted from the Weſt-ſide; where, upon a little riſing-ground under the adjacent Mountains, they raiſed their Battery. They ſay, that it did formerly belong to the Emperour of Germany, and was built by a Queen of Hungary. Since the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians had it, they have blown up part of the Rock on the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, to make it yet more unacceſſible. Other Walls it hath none, but the Rocks, and ſome few Mounds of Earth, without any regularity. On the top, which is very narrow, but long, I perceived ſome old Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Walls, which, with an Inſcription or two, that we ſaw after at Trau brought from hence, made us believe, that it was a place of Antiquity. A Bow-ſhot from hence, Northwards, we entred the Grand Signiors Dominions. There are two Companies of Foot, and half a Troop of Horſe that guard this Caſtle. But the greateſt part of theſe commonly quarter at Spalatro, now they have Peace; only a ſufficient number is left here to keep Guard. They have no Water but what falls from Heaven, or is brought up to them with much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour from a Fountain in the Village, under the Caſtle.</p>
            <p>Another day we went to ſee a Convent, that lieth North-Weſt of the Town, ſituate at the bottom of a little Bay of the Sea. It is called
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95495:24"/>
               <hi>Madonna di Paludi,</hi> or <hi>our Lady of the Marſhes.</hi> It hath a pretty Church, and pleaſant Gardens. I think the Fathers are of the Order of Saint Antonio of Padua. Some time after we took a walk towards the Weſt Promontory of the Haven, and paſſed along the Coaſt two or three miles. Firſt by a Convent of Greek Monks, whoſe Church is dedicated to Saint Hierome; and a good way further, towards the Cape, or Lands-End, of this little Territory, is a ſmall Fort, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, which ſerveth for no other uſe than a Watch-Tower. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, we made towards a Rocky Mountain Northwards, thorough very pleaſant Groves of Olives, that covered us from the heat of the Sun, which would otherwiſe have been very troubleſome, from its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon thoſe Rocks in ſuch direct rays. Here we climbed up to a Hermitage, cut in the Rock, which had two or three pretty Cells, but not very cleanly. Nearer the Town, I clambered up a high Rock, that commands it, to take a proſpect of it with my Pencil; where I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to wiſh that I had had more skill to have deſigned one of the moſt delightful places that I had ever ſeen.</p>

            <p>Growing upon the Steeple here, and on other hard Walls, I found a Plant, which I knew not how to call, unleſs <hi>Equiſetum Fruteſcens.</hi> It is a Perennial-Plant, which hath a weak, long, and ſlender Branch, in colour and ſubſtance like ordinary White Jeſſamine, and without leaves; full of joynts, at about an Inch diſtance from each other; out of each of which, in the faſhion of ordinary Horſe-tail, round the joynt, grow other Branches, that run out a great length, and are joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like the firſt Stalk. Out of each joynt come little, yellowiſh, ſcaly knobs, by pairs, like that on the top of Horſe-tail, but leſs. In a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſcope it looketh ſomething like a Hop; between whoſe Scales iſſue forth three or four little flowers, with four leaves or knobs apiece. Whether this bears any fruit, I know not. At Troy I found another Plant, differing only from this, that That was <hi>Arboreſcens,</hi> and This <hi>Fruteſcens.</hi> The Noble Venetian, that there Commanded as Count of this place, was called <hi>Franceſco Lauredano,</hi> who had been Provedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of Cerigo. He ſhewed us ſome Pillars, which he brought from thence, which look like Tranſparent Marble; but they are but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelations of Water, that petrifie in the Grotts of that Iſland.

            <p>Having yet time to ſpare,<note place="margin">Tran.</note> we hired a Boat, and went to Trau, accounted thirteen miles by Sea, and eighteen or twenty by Land, Weſtward of Spalatro. We paſſed in a Channel between the ſhore and the long Scoglio, or little Iſle Bua; to the Weſtern-end of which it is joyned by a Stone-bridg, and to the Firm-Land by a Woodden one: So that it is now an Iſland, whatever it was anciently, and is ſurrounded by the Sea; although its learned Hiſtorian, <hi>Joanni Lucio</hi> proveth, that it was formerly a Peninſula; and that the Channel, that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95495:25"/>now ſeparateth it from the Land, is done by art, and not by nature, againſt Strabo and Ptolomy; to whom it was known by the name of Tragurium.</p>
            <p>The ſituation is very pleaſant, having good Gardens on the Land Northwards, and a handſome Bourg on the Scoglio South. The Dome is well built, and ancient. The Chappel on the North-ſide is ſet round with Statues; of which thoſe of Saint Peter and Saint Paul are good. But the chief reaſon that made us take this days Voyage, was to ſee a Manuſcript, that hath made much noiſe among the Learned concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Antiquity; to wit, the fragment of <hi>Petronius Arbiter,</hi> which was wanting to his Works: Becauſe for ſome ages this piece had not been ſeen, it was held to be but the fruit of the brain of ſome inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious perſon, who had tried to imitate <hi>Petronins</hi> his Stile. Among others, Monſieur Valois was one, that eſteemed it fictitious: But Signior Lucia, and the Abbot Gradi at Rome were of the contrary opinion; the firſt of whom had undoubtedly ſeen the Manuſcript, Trau being his native Country. The Manuſcript is in the hands of Dr. <hi>Statelius,</hi> a man of parts and learning, but ſickly; not a young man, as Monſieur Valois ſtiles him, with more pride than good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; for he is near Threeſcore years old, and a grave and ſober per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who, it may be, thinks it not worth his pains to anſwer Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Valois, whoſe arguments can be but of little force againſt the credit of ſight. The Remarks that I made of it, are theſe.</p>
            <p>The Manuſcript hath Tibullus, Catullus, and Propertius at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and not Horace, as the Preface to the Padua-Edition affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. In Propertius is to be noted the <hi>Cognomen Nautae,</hi> that Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger taketh notice of in his Notes.</p>
            <p>After theſe followeth in the ſame hand, and on the ſame ſort of paper, eaten alike by the Worms, on the corners of the Margent, <hi>Petrontus Arbiter,</hi> as it is printed; whoſe Title, written in red Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is as followeth.</p>

            <p>In which, among others, the <hi>Coena Trimalcionis</hi> is very amply related, as it is printed at Padua, and in Holland. After which, in a more modern hand is written <hi>Claudian.</hi> Dr. Statelius made us alſo take notice, that at the end of Catullus (which is of the Book pag. 179.) at the lower corner of the Margent (the corner of which is eaten off with the Worms, with ſeveral other leaves) is the Date, written in the ſame ancient hand with the <hi>P. Arbiter,</hi> Thus:

            <p>Here we waited on Signior Dragatzo, Doctor of the Law, an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and civil perſon alſo; who ſhewed us, in his Garden, and other places about the Town, half a dozen of ancient Roman Inſcriptions,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95495:26"/>which he would have made a preſent of to us, could we have had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience to have tranſported them. Hence we returned again to Spalatro the ſame evening.</p>
            <p>The Embaſſadour, being weary of the Sea by that time he arrived at Spalatro, reſolved to make the reſt of his Journey by Land, to the Grand Signior's Court, which was then at Adrianople. But the Gallies that accompanied him, and carried the Preſents, which the State makes by every Embaſſadour to the Port, and his other Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, proceeded as far as Corfu. Therefore ſo ſoon as the Horſes were come, which were ſent for four or five days Journey off, in the Turkiſh Territories, he departed by Land, and we with the Galles for Corfu, where they were to put all on board the Ships which waited there for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>July the Thirteenth, on Sunday-morning, by two a Clock, after eleven days ſtay at Spalatro, we parted, and came by noon to Leſina, which lieth Thirty miles from Spalatro.</p>

            <p>Leſina is the Iſle Ptolomy calls Pharia,<note place="margin">Leſina.</note> and Strabo, Pharos. It is very high, rocky, and mountainous, and by computation a hundred miles in circuit. It hath a good Haven at the South-end, where the Town is called by the name of the Iſle. It repreſents the Form of a Theater; whereof the Town poſſeſſeth the place of the ſpectators; yet appeareth moſt beautiful to thoſe that enter the Area; which is the Port; being built in ſeveral degrees one above another, according to the riſing of the ground; having a Cittadel on the top of a ſteep Rock, backed with exceeding high Mountains. It lies againſt the South, and hath a Harbour, ſecured from that Wind by the Roeks, that lie before it. They have beautified the Shore, on each ſide,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95495:26"/>with a good Mole, made out of the Rocks, which there are in too great plenty. To conclude, it hath good Moorage, and is deep enough for Ships of any rate. Here is very good Bread and Wine, and good cheap I believe, for our Captain touched here to furniſh himſelf with Biſcuit. Their greateſt Trade is Fiſhing of Sardelli; which are like Anchovies, and ſome think the ſame. In May and June they are caught here, and upon the Shore of Dalmatia, near L'Iſa, South of this Iſle, in ſuch abundance, that they furniſh all Parts of Italy and Greece with them. The Turks take them as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, when they are ſick. They follow a light, and flock together about a Boat that carries it in the night; and ſo are caught with great facility.</p>
            <p>With no ſmall difficulty I gat on the top of the higheſt Mountain, that overlooketh the Town, and was recompenſed for my pains with an unbounded proſpect. Hence I diſcerned a Promontory near Zara, which the Watch-men upon it aſſured me was a hundred miles off. Hence Spalatro lies North Thirty miles, and Liſſa as much to the South. Hence Ships, Gallies, Barques, and other Veſſels, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned a vaſt way off, by the Watch-men, who give notice by ſigns to the Fort below, how many, what they are, and which way they fail.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral good Buildings here; eſpecially the Domo and Town-houſe; and in a word, the ſituation is very agreeable.</p>
            <p>In climbing up to the Fort and Mountain, I obſerved, among others, theſe Plants:
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Aconitum Lycoctinum, flore Delphinii:</hi> which I took to be a kind of <hi>Monks-head.</hi>

                  </item>
                  <item>4. <hi>Malva Romana rubra,</hi> or <hi>red Holihachs.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. <hi>Juniperus Major,</hi> or <hi>Oxy-cedrus:</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>6. <hi>Linaria tenui folio.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>7. <hi>Geniſta,</hi> or <hi>Spartium ſeptimum Bauhini,</hi> as I believe. Its Root is thick, and of ſubſtance like <hi>Pimpinella;</hi> out of which ſpring ſome half a dozen, or more branches, of a handful or two high, without leaves, of a light, green colour, and of a ſubſtance like Spaniſh-broom, but beyond compariſon leſs: It ſtill divides it ſelf into three twigs; ſometimes one of thoſe three points divides it ſelf into three more. That which makes me doubt whether it be this, as Monſieur Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaund of Paris hath named it, is, That the Root ſeemeth hot, and of a ſpicy taſte.</item>
                  <item>8. <hi>Piloſella major piloſiſſima.</hi> This Plant is very like to <hi>Great Mouſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ear,</hi> in leaves and height, being half a foot high, or more, and the leaves near as long. But the hair is of ſuch a prodigious length, that it is to be wondred at; being little leſs than an Inch long, and very thick.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>We parted hence after Dinner, and arrived that evening at Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zola, called by <hi>Strabo Corcyra Nigra.</hi> This Iſland belonged formerly to the Republique of Raguſa, and was taken from them by the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians, by this pleaſant ſtratagem. The Venetians had a little Iſland,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95495:27"/>called <hi>Saint Mark;</hi> ſo near to Raguſa, that it commanded the Town, and yet nearer a little Rock, that had no more plain ground on the top, then would be ſufficient to lay the Foundations of a little houſe. Hither the Venetians, upon ſome high diſguſt, ſent men one night, that built a little Fort of Paſt-board, painted of the colour of Earth, which made it look like a ſtrong Rampart, and thereon planted Wooden Cannons, to the great amazement of the Towns-people next morning; which in effect put them into ſuch a fright, that they ſent preſently to parly, and were glad to come off for the Iſland of Curzola in exchange of that pittiful Rock. They ſtood for the Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio of Saint Mark alſo; but the Venetians would not part with that. And ſo they loſt Curzola, which is of great uſe to the Venetians, who come hither often to mend and repair their Veſſels, the Iſland being well covered with Woods. The Town is of the ſame name with the Iſland, and ſituated upon a Peninſula. They ſay, that the Walls of it were built by Diocleſian. The Domo alſo, now dedicated to Saint Mark, is an ancient Edifice, and ſtands upon an Eminence in the middle of the Town, where all the ſtreets meet. Upon one corner of the Front, on the top, is the Buſt of a Woman with a crowned head. The people there believe it was Diocleſian's Empreſs; to which my companion gave little credit, having never ſeen it, neither in Medals nor in Statue: But it is without doubt ancient; as alſo the Church, built of Marble, dug in the Iſle: and ſo are moſt part of the Houſes; but not poliſhed like the Palaces of Genua. It is a Biſhops ſeat, and governed by a Venetian-Count. There are five Villages beſides upon the Iſland, which are ſuppoſed to contain fourteen or fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Souls apiece; but the City not above one thouſand. For the compaſs of the Walls is but ſmall. The abundance of the Woods ſerveth for a refuge for ſeveral ſorts of wild creatures, eſpecially an Animal (as they ſay) made like a Dog; but which maketh a noiſe like a Calf, or Peacock. When they light any fire near the Woods in the night, they hear numbers of them howl together; which make a hideous noiſe: Thoſe that hear them, would think they were people that cry a-far off. Of theſe we heard many between Smyrna and Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, when we had the misfortune to loſe our way on the Plains, in a wet and thund'ring night, as I ſhall have occaſion again to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. To the North of this place, on the Continent, runneth a long ſlip of Land, which maketh a narrow Channel between the Main-Land and it, called Sabioneira; and thereon ſtands a Town of the ſame name, juſt oppoſite to this, belonging to the Republique of Raguſa, where they have many delightful and fruitful Gardens, as we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
            <p>This evening we advanced a little further in the Channel to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of Cordeliers, called <hi>Madonna del Scoglio,</hi> upon the ſhore of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bioneira. It was formerly a Greek Church, but now belongeth to Latin Monks. It was robbed by the Turks about Ten years ago; who then carried away the Tabernacle, and took the Holy Sacrament, and trod it under foot; which was, without doubt, done in indignation to the Roman Superſtition; which is the cauſe that thoſe Infidels are ſo ſcandaliz'd at the whole Chriſtian Religion, that they will learn Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95495:27"/>enough to upbraid the Franks (as they call all the Weſtern Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians) with it. <hi>Canagli di Chriſtiani, fate il Veſtro dio, e lo Mangiate.</hi> You raſcally Chriſtians, who make your God, and eat him when you have done. But it is our duty, who enjoy ſo much liberty, and have often the opportunity, to teach them, how to make diſtinction between the glorious light of the Goſpel we enjoy and profeſs, and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Superſtition they with ſo much reaſon abominate. The adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hill yields a good proſpect, and hath on the top a little Church, dedicated to Saint Catharine. There you ſee the Sea on both ſides of this long Tongue of Land; which is pleaſantly covered with Woods of Myrtle-Trees, that were then in the flower, and made the whole Air thereabouts moſt fragrant. Here I ſaw Aloes in the Flower; and I judge the Stems of it were five or ſix yards high.</p>
            <p>The next day we ſail'd between Sabioniera, and the Iſle Meleda, leaving Auguſta more out at Sea between Curzola and that; and having paſt ſeveral other Rocks, or Iſlands we came to the Port Santa Croce, which belongeth to the Republique of Raguſa, and is the beſt I had ſeen all along thoſe Coaſts. The entrance into it is very good, and the Port large, deep, and ſecure, being every way Land-lock'd, by Mountains round it, covered with Vineyards, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and Houſes of pleaſure, of the Raguzians. The City Raguſa is very near, but not ſeen from thence, by reaſon of a high hill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing. We had not the ſatisfaction to ſee it, becauſe we ſuſpected it to be infected with the Plague, but paſſed in ſight of it next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Raguſians have not recovered themſelves yet, ſince the terrible Earthquake, that happened there about twelves years ago; by which the greateſt part of their City, and Citizens, were ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by the Earth. I heard a Seaman, that was then in the Port Santa Croce, affirm, that they looked every minute, when their Ship ſhould have been ſhaken in pieces on the water; a thing not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable by any Phaenomena in nature that I know of. He told me alſo, that the water boiled like a pot; which was undoubtedly cauſed by the vapours riſing from the Subterraneous Parts beneath the water. They here voluntarily put themſelves under the protection of the Turks, to whom they pay tribute for the ſecurity they enjoy. The next day we paſſed by this place, and Raguza Vechia (or Old Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guza), where is ſuppoſed was Epidaurus of the Ancients. Thence by Caſtle-novo, on the Channel of Catoro; the firſt place on theſe Coaſts, that belongeth to the Turks. Here we put in at a Port, called Madonna de Janici, from a Chappel ſo called on the ſhore. From this place we had a good proſpect of Caſtle-novo, within the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel; which I took as well as I could.</p>

            <p>Hence after dinner we ſtood out to Sea, that we might ſhoot the Gulph of Londrin; but ſtill within ſight of Land, until we had paſſed Budua, the laſt place of the Venetians on theſe Coaſts, and Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cignia, which perhaps were thoſe which Ptolomy calls Bulua and Ulcinium. We had no ſooner loſt ſight of the Dalmatian-ſhore, but that we deſcried the Mountains of Macedonia. This Gulph was called anciently the Gulph of Apollonia, where Caeſar eſcaped nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly with his Life and Fleet. It is a very dangerous paſſage, and is above a hundred and eighty miles over. And therefore leſſer Barques are forced to make the compaſs round by ſhore, as my companion did in his return, who hath given us this account of it. <q>Going along the ſhore,<note place="margin">Ulcinium.</note> we ſaw Dulcigno (in times paſt Ulcinium) belonging to the Turks, which may contain ſeven or eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Souls, and is an indifferent good Scale, that is to ſay in the Levant-language, a City of Traffique. The Franks have there a Conſul.</q> Next is Durazzo; which was the Dyrrachium of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, and is now but a Village, with a ruined Fort. At length we came to the Gulph of Boyana, with a River of the ſame name, that emptieth it ſelf therein, and which was called Drillo in times paſt. On the ſame ſhore runs the River Pollona, to which the nearneſs of Apollonia hath given the name. The Water remaineth, but the Town is utterly deſtroyed: and there alſo ſtands Aulen, which by corruption is now called Valona. Thirty miles thence to Landward is a Mountain, where riſeth a Fountain of Pitch, of which the Ancients make mention, and with which they caren Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, being mixed with Tarr. The Rock Saſſino, about ſix miles from Valona, boundeth the Gulph of Lodrino to the South-Eaſt.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95495:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>Not far from Saſſino, North-Eaſt, are the Fats of Piſcaria, where they catch abundance of Fiſh. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Paſſing this Gulph, in the morning, as ſoon as it was light, we perceiv'd a far off a ſmall Veſſel, that we took to be a Pirate; which as ſoon as it ſaw us, tacked about, and fled; and thereby confirmed us in that opinion, eſpecially ſo ſoon as we perceiv'd that he made towards Vallona. But we purſued them ſo hotly, that in leſs than an hour we came within Cannon-ſhot of them, and fired two or three ſhot ſo near, as obliged them to ſtrike ſail, and come by our Lee. It proved nevertheleſs to be only a Barque of Cephalonia, laden with Cheeſe and Oyl for Venice; who took us to be as very Corſaires, as we did them; our Officers being ſorry to have miſs'd the Booty they expected; and the others glad, that they had eſcaped ſo well the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they fear'd, we, each of us purſued our courſe.</p>
            <p>Over againſt Saſſino we had the proſpect of thoſe high Mountains, called formerly Acroceraunii, now called Chimera.<note place="margin">Chimera.</note> Towards the Sea-ſide there are five or ſix Villages, which defend themſelves againſt the Turks, and will not pay him the Carattle, or Tribute of Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money. The principal of theſe Villages is called Chimera, ſituate upon the top of a Rock, having Precipices on all ſides; whither all the Country-people retire, when need requireth. If they ſhould be aſſaulted by Sea, they retreat into the Mountains, which are almoſt inacceſſible, and drive away with them all their cattel: But if they are ſet on by Land, there are ſo many narrow paſſages, that they may be able to defeat an Army, meerly by tumbling down Stones upon them. They have a Harbour called Porto-panormo. They follow the Greek Religion, and in Spiritual affairs are ſubject to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Janina, a Town in Theſſaly, about two days Journey from thence. They are eſteemed good Soldiers, being deſcended of the ſtout race of the Macedonians; and are as bad Robbers as the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notti, who are come of the Lacedemonians: Two people, in times paſt, equally famous for War, though now the off-ſpring of both be as infamous for Robbery: For they ſay, They will ſell Turks to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and Chriſtians to Turks. The Wind being fair, we ſtaied not at Saſſino, but ſailed on, until we came at the Iſland Corfu.</p>
            <p>Corfu was formerly called Corcyra,<note place="margin">Corfu.</note> as I find in many Greek Medals I brought with me from thence. An Iſland of ancient Fame, which had, without doubt, the Emperour Septimius Severus, and his Family,<note place="margin">Med. 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11.</note> for its Great Benefactors. For there is lately found abundance of his Medals, and of Julia Domna his Empreſs, and of his Son Antoninus Caracalla, and of Plautilla his Empreſs; and of Geta, his other Son, (who both ſucceeded him in the Empire.) Thoſe of Plautilla are rarely to be found any where elſe. Of which, becauſe I have ſeveral Medals, not ordinarily to be met with, and no-where printed as I know of, except by its Worthy and Nobly - deſcended Hiſtorian, Cavalier Marmero, I ſhall for the ſatisfaction of the curious, here preſent the Reverſes of them to publick view.</p>

This little Church is famous for a Picture of our Lady, to which they attribute Miracles, and whereof I had a mind to try the skill. The way is thus:</p>
            <p>Strangers, that have a mind to know whether their Friends are alive or dead, go to the Picture, and clap a piece of money upon it, thinking of ſome friend. If the perſon they think of be alive, the piece will ſtick faſt; but if dead, it will drop down into a Sack placed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-neath: ſo that, dead or alive, the Prieſt is ſure of the money. I applied ſome Farthings, which I had, to try how, and where they would ſtick; but had no other thought, nor end, being before well ſatisfied, that it was but a ridiculous jugling. Some of them indeed ſtuck, but all to one and the ſame place; thoſe that were clapt on any where elſe, falling ſtill to the ground. The Picture is painted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Walls, and is very ſmooth and ſhining; ſo that I attribute the ſticking to ſome clammineſs of the Varniſh; which they take care, ſhall never be wanting in ſome places of it. Among the Ruins of the Caſtle, I ſaw a vaſt, great Snake; I believe above two yards long, and big as the ſmall of a mans leg, of a dark brown colour; thicker alſo at the tail, than ours are; ſo that I take it to be a different
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95495:29"/>Species from ours. I ſaw another afterward of the ſame kind; but not ſo big.</p>
            <p>The next day, being the Eighteenth of July, we came to the City, now called by the name of the Iſland. It is not a hundred years, ſince this City was nothing but the old Caſtle, and the preſent Suburbs of Caſtati. But now it is a good large City, and well fortified with Walls on the South, and two Caſtles at the Eaſt and Weſt-Ends; though the ſide towards the Harbour be not ſo well fortified, as not ſo much needing it. It would be a Town almoſt impregnable, were it not for a Rock that ſtandeth towards the Weſt, and commandeth the adjoyning Fort, with a great part of the Town. The other Caſtle, or Fort, ſtands upon a Rock every way inacceſſible, running out like a Promontory in the Sea. This is the place of Reſidence of the Venetian-Generals of the Levant by Sea and Land; and to whom, from the other Proveditours of Zant and Cephalonia, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Appeals may be made, and a new Hearing had of all Civil Cauſes before him, as Chief Judg under the Senate, as well as Chief Commander of all their Forces. He who had this Command then, was Signior Priuli. We being taken notice of here for deſigning places as we paſt, were taken for ſpies: So that order was given by the General, that none ſhould be admitted into the Forts; inſomuch, that we could not at that time well know their ſtrength. But as I returned, and touched here, I had ſo much time as to ſee this Caſtle; which is well provided with Ammunition and Artillery. To the Weſtward of it is a large place, which they call the Splanade; from the middle of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth a large ſtreet, that runneth Weſtward thorough the City. On the right hand, in this ſtreet, ſtandeth the Cathedral Church, dedicated to Saint Spiridion, firſt Biſhop of that place, whoſe Body they are perſwaded they have, and there with great Veneration pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it. They attribute to him the doing a Miracle about Thirty-five years ſince, reſtoring the ſight to a blind man, who came, and prayed to him, proſtrating himſelf before his Body. And of this they keep an Annual remembrance ever ſince; which happened when we were here. They make profeſſion of the Greek Religion; but are in moſt things Latinized, except in Obedience to the Sea of Rome, the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of the Pope, and the Proceſſion of the Holy Spirit. They have not a Greek Biſhop allowed them; but there is a Latin one, and a Protopappa Greek. This Church is well furniſhed with Silver Lamps; and one of Gold, given by a Gentleman of Corfu; who, by his Will, left Five thouſand Cichins (which amount to about Three thouſand pounds ſterling) to buy it.</p>
            <p>Here are ſeveral ingenious men, and moderately learned; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Cavalier Marmero, who hath writ the Hiſtory of this place in Italian; and hath a Collection of Medals; but moſt of them, ſuch as concern the Antiquity of the place.<note place="margin">He derives his name from the Iſle Marmero, in the Propon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, of which his Family were once Maſters.</note> He is a perſon of great Worth and Honour, both as to his perſonal Qualities, and his Extraction, being deſcended of the Family Comneno, Emperours of Greece. This little digreſſion, Reader, I owe to this Generous Friend, whoſe name I have reaſon to mention with gratitude.</p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:95495:30"/>
            <p>The Protopappa, or Chief Prieſt, called Panagiotti Bulgary, is but young; yet Learned not only in Greek, but Latin. He gave us ſome Books of the Office uſed in Honour of Saint Spiridion; with a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Life, to preſent to the Patriarch of Conſtantinople.</p>
            <p>Hieraſſimo Machi, Abbot of Palaiopolis, is alſo a Learned man; who retired hither from Candia, after it was ſurrendred to the Turks. He hath a Study of a great many M. SS; amongſt which are twenty, never yet printed: as a Commentary of Origen upon the Goſpel of Saint John, Saint <hi>Auguſtin de Trinitate</hi> Tranſlated out of Latin into Greek; one of which I bought afterwards at Athens, among other Manuſcripts, and the Sermons of Ephrem, an ancient Monk. He hath printed a Dictionary Tetraglot, Ancient and Vulgar Greek, Latin, and Italian; as alſo a Syſteme of Philoſophy.</p>
            <p>He hath a Nephew, named Arſenio Calluti, who is alſo Learned in Latin, Greek, and Divinity, and is eſteemed a good Preacher. He Studied at Padua, and is now firſt Pappa of the Church Panthagii, or All-Saints, in Palaiopoli. Among his Books he ſhewed us a Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of Saint John Damaſcen, never yet printed as I know of, and is a kind of Epitome of all his Works. And another, being a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary of Ptocho-prodromus on the Hymns of the Greek Church. There are alſo ſeveral other Learned men there, as namely Dr. <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pello,</hi> young, but skillful in the Civil Law, and in other Gentile Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He told us he had compoſed a Dictionary in Vulgar Greek, Latin and Italian, more ample than any yet extant. The Doctors Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niani and Lupina are likewiſe men of eſteem there.</p>
            <p>But I muſt not forget my good Friend <hi>Signior Spiridiani Arbeniti,</hi> who hath alſo a little Collection of very curious Medals, a great lover of Antiquity, and a very civil perſon. He received us with the greateſt kindneſs imaginable, taking the pains to ſhew us all things that are rare in that place. Sometimes he went with us a foot, and at other times, when need required, furniſhed us with his own and friends Horſes, and always favoured us with his good company.</p>

We had a preſent ſent us of Figs, Filberds, and Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant-grapes, then ſcarce ripe; the Figs being a large, green kind, they call Fracaſſans, having in the middle a round lump of Jelly, of the bigneſs of a Nutmeg, very delicious, and refreſhing in the heats of Summer.

It ſtood on a Promontory to the South of the preſent City, ſeparated from it by a little Bay, of about a mile or two over. The abundance of Ruins and Foundations, which are to be ſeen there, do ſufficiently demonſtrate it to have been ſo. The ground it covered is almoſt an Iſland, and therefore anciently called Cherſopolis. It had on the South-Weſt a good large Port, for Veſſels of thoſe days; but now has hardly water enough for ſmall Shallops. The mouth is narrow, and was ſecured by a Chain; the place to which it was faſtened, being yet to be ſeen. There has been formerly an Aqueduct, to bring freſh water to it, from a Spring, which we ſaw by a Church towards the Sea-ſide; from whence the Water was conveyed by a Channel made thorough the Rock in Earthen-Gutters, of about a yard long, and an inch thick apiece, curiouſly joyned to one another; whereof great quantities are found thereabouts. Beſides abundance of Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Temples, Arches, Pillars, and Marble Inſcriptions, have been dug up here, and employed to build the new Fortifications of the preſent City. Signior Marmero, in his Hiſtory, hath given a Plane of the old City; which is now covered all over with Olive-trees, and here and there an old Church ſtanding among them: the two chief, that ſtill remain, are Panagia, of which Pappa Ulachi is Abbot, and Pantagi, whereof Pappa Canuti is Rector. The Portal of the firſt, whoſe Architrave is ſuſtained by Corinthian Pillars of white Marble, hath an Inſcription, ſhewing that it was built by the Emperour Jovia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, after he was converted to the Chriſtian Faith, and had deſtroyed the Heathen Temples: the meaning whereof in Engliſh is thus:

The other Church is built much after the former manner, and hath an Inſcription on it; which Monſieur Spon thinketh to have been made about the ſixth Century. Count Marmero hath taken the pains to tranſcribe and interpret it. It ſheweth, that it was built by one Stephanus, Biſhop of the place, for the remiſſion of his Sins.</p>
            <p>On the South-Weſt ſide of Paloeopoli, about two or three miles off, is a Plain, well watered with ſeveral Brooks of freſh water, which make the ſoil fruitful. It is judged to have been the Gardens of Alcinous, King of this place, famous in Homer. It is called now by the Virtuoſi Chryſida, and by the Country people Pezamili, from ſome Mills that are there. Here we were full of Homer, eſpecially his relation of the Kings daughter Nauſica's adventure; who going to Bathe her ſelf with her Attendants, met with Ulyſſes caſt upon that ſhore by a Storm. My Comerade telleth us,<note place="margin">Med. 12.13.</note> that he had ſeen a Medal of this brave Dame at Balogna; which he hath cauſed to be engraven as a great rarity. I have therefore thought it worth the copying alſo.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of Corfu are of a very revengeful nature, never forgetting any injury done them; which is often the ruin of whole Families. For they eſpouſe the quarrels of their Relations, from gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to generation, and perſecute them, till one of the Parties, and ſometimes both, be utterly extinct. They themſelves confeſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late moſt barbarous adventures of this nature, that have happened in the Iſland. One I remember, though not the names of the Actors of that Tragedy. There happened a quarrel between two families, upon no great occaſion at firſt; but at laſt was brought up to ſuch a height, that ſeveral perſons were killed on both ſides; eſpecially on his ſide, who was the principal party offended. This man, dying, left only a young Son; to whom, when he came to age ſeveral years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it was propoſed, that he ſhould Marry a daughter of his Fathers enemy, that ſo all differences might be ended, and a laſting Peace made between the two families. After much ſollicitation he agreed to it, ſo that a Dowry was concluded on, and Married they were, with a great deal of ſeeming joy. But not long after, having carried his new-married Wife home to his houſe, and having thither invited her Parents, Siſters, Brothers, and other Relations of hers, he perſwaded them to ſtay all night, and barbarouſly Murder'd every one of them, Wife and all.</p>
            <p>After we knew what Ships were determined to go to Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, we went and waited on the General to deſire his favour, that we might have paſſage in one of them. They were in all ſix Sail; whereof Two Men of War, and a Merchant-man, were bound for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople; and the other, Three Men of War, no further than <hi>Tine,</hi> thither to carry a new Proveditor. The General, after a very civil Conference, gave us Warrant to Embarque on the Guerriera Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante; being now informed that we were Gentlemen, and that it was meerly curioſity that made us ſo inquiſitive.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:95495:31"/>
            <p>The Twenty-firſt of July we went on board, and ſet ſail for Zant; but the Wind being contrary, and having but little Sea-room between the Iſland and the Continent, our Boats were ſo ſhort, that we made little, or no way, until the Third day. The Wind then tacking about to the North, we ſoon got out, and doubled the Southern Cape of the Iſland; beyond which there are ſome Flats, and Rocks by it above water; called Paxo, and Antipaxo, by the Venetians; but by Sanſon, Paſcu, &amp;c. Afterwards we left the Iſland Saint Mauro, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that, Cephalonia, the chief Iſland of Ulyſſes his Dominions: of which before I ſay any thing more, Monſieur Spon muſt give me leave to correct an error or two he hath committed, concerning Corfu, comparing it with Cephalonia, where he ſays, <hi>Afterward we paſſed in ſight of the Iſland of Cephalonia, twice as big as that of Corfu: For that hath about an hundred and forty miles in circuit, and this not above ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty.</hi> Whereas Count Marmero ſheweth, that Pliny counted Corfu Ninety-ſeven miles long, as he ſuppoſes, taking the Iſland Paxo with it, now diſtant from Corfu, ten miles; and he at preſent reckons it about ſeventy miles in length, and twenty broad at the North-Weſt end, and ten at the South-Eaſt. Whence he concludeth it a hundred and eighty miles about. But his Map added, and publiſhed with his Book, if meaſured by his Scale, maketh it eighty miles long, and from thence ten to Paxo; which Scoglio perhaps makes the other ſeven mentioned by him. However I do agree that Cephalonia is the bigger Iſland; for although it be not much longer than Corfu, it is as wide again.</p>
            <p>Cephalonia is fruitful in Oyl, and excellent Wines,<note place="margin">CEPHALO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIA.</note> eſpecially red Muſcatels (which we call Luke Sherry), and in thoſe Grapes whereof Currans are made, that yield conſiderable profit. The place of reſidence of the Proveditor is Argoſtoli, where there is a large Port, every way Land-lock't, but hath no good Anchoridge. At the mouth of the Port indeed is another Village, called Luxuri, but not many Curran-Merchants reſide there, as he ſaith, for Zant is the place of their ordinary Reſidence, where they come yearly to buy up the Currans to tranſport. A little while ſince here happened a kind of Civil War between two families. They made a faction of fifty or threeſcore of a ſide; who gave combat to each other, and fought as bloodily, as Turks would do againſt Chriſtians. The Venetian Governours had not power enough to appeaſe the quarrel. But after they were weary, they made peace upon condition, that the one party ſhould not enter into the others quarters on pain of death. There is a Harbour on the Eaſt-ſide of the Iſland, where we caſt Anchor upon our return from Zant to Venice. It is called Peſcarda, proper only for little Veſſels. There is to be ſeen here a little ruined Village, where nothing now remains, but a ſmall Church, and ſome few Caloyers.</p>
            <p>Over againſt Peſcarda is the Iſle Thiaki, ſeparated from it only by a Streight of three or four miles over; for which reaſon ſome call it Little Cephalonia. The likeneſs of its name hath made it be taken for Ithaca, one of the principal Iſles of Ulyſſes his Kingdom, and is placed there by Sanſon and Sophianus. But they may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95495:32"/>For Strabo, ſpeaking of Ithaca, gives it but eighty Stadia about, which maketh about ten Italian miles: and this Iſland is at leaſt the double. Therefore I believe, that Ithaca is another little Iſland, ſeven or eight miles from hence, called yet Ithaca; which is much leſs than this; I believe anciently called Dulichium, becauſe it hath at the Eaſt-ſide a Port, with the Ruins of a Town called yet Dolichia, as Strabo obſerved, it was called in his time; which to me is ſatisfaction enough; though Strabo notwithſtanding ſeemeth to favour thoſe that take Thiaki for Ithaca. But, perhaps, Strabo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did not know the true ſituation; the ancient names being in his time changed. For, laſtly, if we have recourſe to what Homer hath ſaid of it, it ſeemeth that Dulichium was none of the Iſles Echinades, as the Geographers after-him have judged; however it is a queſtion not ſo eaſily decided. Two Engliſh Ships go yearly to this Thiaki, to lade Currans. The Iſle is cultivated by the Inhabitants, who are reduced to three Villages, called Onoi, Vathi, and Oxia. In a Wood there are to be ſeen the Ruins of an old Caſtle; which the Iſlanders tell you, was the Palace of Ulyſſes. As to the Iſle Ithaca, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, and thoſe of Thiaki go thither to till it in its ſeaſons. The Iſle of Cephalonia in Homer's time was called Samos, and had a Town of that name; which ſhould not have been far from the Port Peſcarda, of which we have already ſpoken. Cephalonia was the greateſt Iſland of Ulyſſes his Kingdom; and I wonder that Strabo maketh it not above Three hundred Stadia in circuit; which amount but to Thirty-eight Italian miles; and Pliny no more than Forty-four miles; although indeed it hath more than a hundred and twenty miles in compaſs. But I will not find fault with the ancient Geographers, ſince our Moderns, who beſide the old Geography, have the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the ages ſince, do notwithſtanding make moſt groſs mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes in their Maps of theſe parts. Of Saint Mauro, he continueth thus:</p>
            <p>Since we are in the Kingdom of Ulyſſes, let us not quit it ſo ſoon, but ſpeak ſomething of the Iſland Saint Mauro.<note place="margin">St. MAURO.</note> This Iſland was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently called Leucada; and the Modern Greeks call it ſo yet: for the Caſtle only is properly called Saint Mauro, from a Convent which ſtood there, whileſt it was under the Venetians. Returning to Venice we were obliged to touch at a Port of it,<note place="margin">CLIMENO.</note> called Climeno, which is the beſt in the Iſland, having good Depth and Anchoridge. From thence the phanſie took us to go ſee the Fortreſs, and to that end took a Boat, called Monoxylo, to carry us thither. We rowed four or five hours in the narrow Channel, that ſeparates it from the Continent, before we arrived at it. Strabo-ſaith, that it was anciently joyned to the Land; and that this Streight was dug to ſeparate it; which is likely enough. For in the ſtreighteſt part it doth not much exceed fifty paces over, and almoſt everywhere three or four foot of water. It is in this narroweſt part of the Streight, that the ancient City, Leucada, had its ſituation, upon an Eminence a mile from the Sea; of which ſome Remains are yet to be ſeen; having for its Port the whole Channel, eſpecially thoſe Parts, where there was Water enough. Ortelius and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95495:32"/>Ferrarius are miſtaken, in believing, that this City was, where now Saint Mauro ſtands. They have not been upon the place, to find, that Saint Mauro is three miles from thence, in the middle of the Channel, where it is a League over. The Fortreſs is good, and hath ſome round Baſtions, ſituated upon a very low ground. But that, which renders it conſiderable is, that it neither can be approached to by Land, nor Sea, unleſs in thoſe Monoxylo's, or little Barques, which draw not above a foot of water. It is ſeparated by a ditch of thirty, or forty foot wide, from two little Iſlands, which are as the Suburbs to the Fortreſs, and are inhabited by Turks and Greeks. Their Houſes are very low, and built of wood: But to make amends, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves go very well cloathed, and are great Pirats in thoſe Seas. The Baſha of the Morea came thither this year on purpoſe, to burn their Galliots, or little Gallies; whereof Durag Beg, a famous Pirate of Lepanto, had formerly ſeven or eight under his Command. We left our little Boat aſhore, and went to Saint Mauro on an Aqueduct a mile long, which ſerveth as a Bridge for thoſe that will go thither on foot, though it be not above a yard broad, and without any hold; which would make the ſtouteſt man tremble in paſſing it, eſpecially if he meet any other thereon. For it is as much as two can do to paſs by one another. There is above Five or ſix thouſand Inhabitants in the Cittadel and Suburbs. But we had made but very hard cheer there, without the Fiſh we carried with us; for we found nothing there, but bad Wine, bad Bread, and worſe Cheeſe. There are about Thirty Villages in the Iſland, inhabited by poor Greeks, that manure the Land, and catch Fiſh; Being under the Juriſdiction of a Biſhop, whoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues apparently are but mean. The Iſle is fruitful enough in Corn, Oranges, Limons, Almonds, and Paſture for their Cattel; and is about Thirty, or Forty miles in compaſs. The Caſtle of Saint Mauro is not above a dozen miles from the Gulph of Ambracia, now called the Gulph <hi>de L'arta;</hi> near which was the renowned City, Actium, famous for the Battle of Auguſtus Caeſar againſt Mark-Antony; but at preſent there is no more talk of this City.</p>
            <p>Not being willing to go thither, we diſcourſed an Underſtanding man of L'arta; who aſſured us, that L'arta, or Arta, was not Ambracia,<note place="margin">L'ARTA.</note> as our Geographers do warrant. But that the City of Ambracia, which gave name to this Gulph, is above a days journey from thence; and is yet called by the Country people <hi>Ambrakia;</hi> though now but a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage about a mile from the Sea, juſt in the bottom of the Bay. That there is a Kanne there, which ſerveth for a Warehouſe, for the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſes, that are brought thither. That the Town Arta is at leaſt ſixteen miles from thence upon the River; which probably is the Ache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of the Ancients; and which according to Pliny diſchargeth it ſelf into the Gulph of Ambracia. Vouro-potami is the Vulgar name of a River, which one paſſeth, coming towards Ambracia, and is, without diſpute, that which in times paſt was called Aracthus; although it paſs not ſo near the Town Ambracia now: perhaps, being bigger in old time, it extended it ſelf even to it.</p>
            <pb n="38" facs="tcp:95495:33"/>
            <p>The mouth of this Gulph is not above a mile and half wide, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is above Threeſcore miles about. On the left hand there is a Fortreſs of Turks, not quite ſo well peopled, as Saint Mauro. It is called Prevenza, and is the place of the ancient Nicopolis, built by Auguſtus, in memory of his Victory over Mark-Antony. In Arta are reckoned ſeven or eight thouſand Inhabitants; whereof the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Greeks exceedeth that of the Turks. Signior Manno Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea, a rich Merchant of that place, told me, that the Cathedral Church of this place, called Evangeliſtra, that is, the Annunciation, is a great Building, that hath as many doors and windows, as there are days in the year, and that it is ſuſtained by above Two hundred Marble Pillars. He added, that an Inſcription over the door ſheweth, that it was built by Duke Michael Comneno. This Town, and the Country round about, Traffick in Tobacco, Botargo, and Furrs; with which they drive a great Trade.</p>
            <p>The Archbiſhop of Arta made his Reſidence, in times paſt, at Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panto; which he now hath left, becauſe there are but few Chriſtians there. He had anciently eight Suffragans: But the Emperour John Palaeologus divided his Province into two Archbiſhopricks, to raiſe that of Janina. The Cities, that are left to Arta, are, 1. <hi>Ragous,</hi> a little Town, ten miles from Prevenza. 2. <hi>Ventza,</hi> a Town and Caſtle, on the other ſide of the Gulph. 3. <hi>Aſtos,</hi> an inland Town, two days Journey from Arta: and 4. <hi>Acheloou,</hi> which taketh his name from the River Acheloous. The Biſhop of this place maketh his Reſidence at Angelo-Caſtro; and hath alſo Zapandi, Maſſa-longi, and Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lico in his Dioceſs.</p>
            <p>Janina is a Town, bigger than Arta, peopled by rich Greek Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. Its Archbiſhop has under him four Biſhopricks. 1. <hi>Argiro-Caſtro,</hi> no great Town. 2. <hi>Delbeno,</hi> which is but a Village. 3. <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinto,</hi> under which are the Villages of the Mountain Chimaera. 4. <hi>Glykeon,</hi> ſo called from a River called Glyki: and this laſt Dioceſs is extended from Paramythia t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But it will not be amiſs (perhaps) to let you know, what theſe Boats, called Monoxyla, are, ſo often made mention of. They are Boats made of the Body of a Tree, all of one piece, as the name implyeth, about fifteen, or twenty foot long, two foot wide, and a foot and half deep, or thereabouts. They were not unknown to the Ancients. Heſychius ſaith, that the Cyprians called them <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, perhaps becauſe they were made of Oak, called in Greek <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. Heliodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus alſo mentions Monoxyla in his Hiſtory. They ſit in the bottom of them, and Row with two Padlers, or little Oars. Monſieur Spon ſaith, he ſaw two Horſes paſs in them over the narroweſt part of the Streight, between the Land and Saint Mauro; which otherwiſe I could not have thought them capable of. I ſaw them uſed at Meſolongia, and Nathaligo, to carry Currans over the Flatts, on board Ships lying in the road before thoſe places.</p>
            <p>But its now time to purſue our Voyage to Zant; where we arrived the Twenty-fourth of July Old, and the fourth of Auguſt, New Stile.</p>

            <p>Zant is but a little Iſland (I believe not above Thirty miles about);<note place="margin">Zant.</note> But to make amends, is one of the moſt fruitful and pleaſant places I ever ſaw. It lieth in 36 degrees, 30 minutes of Northern Latitude, South from Cephalonia, about ten miles and more, off the Morea near thirty miles Eaſt, and hath the Gulph of Lepanto N. E. In old time it was called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Zacynthos, as I have ſeen on ſeveral Medals; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally on one, which I ſaw in Sir Clement Harbie's hands,<note place="margin">Med. 14.</note> the Conſul of this place, who gave me leave to deſign it. It hath on the one ſide the head of ſome Deity, and on the Reverſe Apollo's Tripos, under a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant Sun, with theſe Letters about it,
ΖΛΚΥΝΘΙΩΝ.
The Greeks ſtill call it Zacynthos, the Italians Zanté, and we Zant. It hath been called by Boterus the Golden Iſland; which it well deſerves, becauſe of the fruitfulneſs and pleaſantneſs of its foil and abode. But it now more truly merits that name from the Venetians, who draw ſo much Gold, by the Curran-Trade, from hence and Cephalonia, as beareth the ordinary charge of their Armada at Sea. It is governed by a Venetian Proveditor, and hath one good Port, though it lieth a little bleak to the North-Eaſt Wind; and another on the South-ſide; but is dangerous to thoſe that are ſtrangers to it. Between theſe two Ports runneth a long Promontory Eaſtwards, on which is a high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, called <hi>Madonna di Scoppo,</hi> from a Church there; where there is a Picture, that they perſwade themſelves works Miracles. The Town is ſtretched along the ſhore, and is very populous; as is alſo the whole Iſland; wherein, beſide the City, are reckoned fifty Towns and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages. The Town is backt towards the Weſt with a Fort, ſituated upon a ſteep hill; which caſteth ſuch a reflexion of the Sun upon it, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it extreme hot in Summer, and almoſt an Engliſh Summer in the coldeſt Winter. This Hill abounds with many Springs of excellent
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95495:34"/>good freſh Water: which, although they riſe, ſome not above twenty paces from the Sea, and others nothing near ſo much; yet they are ſo high above the ſurface of the water, as may confute the vulgar error, that would have all Fountains to take their Original from the Sea. For here from high Mountains they powre themſelves into it, as from <hi>Monte di Madonna di Scoppo,</hi> the Fountain Grundinero doth. But if they underſtand that the Sun firſt draweth the water out of the Sea into Clouds, and lets it drop down again in Rain or Snow, upon the Hills; from whence it collects it ſelf into ſubterraneous Channels, and ſo breaks out again in Springs, I will be of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: But not that it paſſeth from the Sea in ſubterraneous Channels to the Fountain, and thence back again from whence it came, above ground: Unleſs they firſt prove, that in Water the contrary Qualities of Gravity and Levity cohabit together. This is plain alſo if we conſider, that Springs are never far from ſome Hill, or Mountain. And that in many dry Summers, where the Hills are not high, and large they abate in their Water, and are often dried quite up: which could never be, if they came immediately from the Sea. For that is never waſted, at leaſt ſenſibly. We may therefore wonder, and adore the Wiſdom of the great Creator of All things, that hath laid the Earth in heaps, and hath lifted up the Rocky Mountains to the Heavens; which we ignorantly call Barren, and the Fable Mocks for only bringing forth of Mice: when they like good, though aged Fathers, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh their children the Valleys with ſuch plentiful ſupplies of ſtreams, as render them ſo abundantly fruitful, and their Fields to ſtand ſo thick with corn, and every thing elſe that is good and beautiful, that they ſeem really to laugh and ſing.</p>
            <p>The Town is well built of Free-ſtone; but the Buildings not very high, by reaſon of the frequent Earth-quakes that happen there: which in the Spring are, ſome years, once or twice a week, and ſo ſhake all the houſes, that the Stone-walls of them are all full of great cracks. One happened while I was there, at my return from Athens, during my Quarentine in the Peſt-houſe. That day it happened the Sun looked of a yellowiſh colour, which was looked upon as ominous. I was ſitting leaning upon a Table; when on the ſudden the Earth was ſo prodigiouſly ſhaken, that I thought the place (which was but one ſtory high) would have immediately fallen on my head, it gave ſuch a crack, and the Chairs, Stools, and Table ſo claſhed together, that they rattled again. The unuſualneſs of the thing made ſo deep an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on my phanſie, that I hardly believed the Earth ſtood ſtill, ſo long as I ſtaid on the Iſland after it. But the Inhabitants are ſo uſed to them, that they make little or nothing of them.</p>
            <p>They profeſs the Greek Religion, but are much Latinized in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, although they extremely hate the Roman Church. They are not allowed a Biſhop, but a Protopappa; and ſubmit themſelves to the Biſhop of Cephalonia. There is here a Latin Biſhop; whom they are hardly conſtrained to uſe civilly. A new one arrived while I was there; and when he made his publick entry, the Greek Prieſts were commanded to attend him to the Cathedral Church in the Fort. He was likewiſe attended by the ſeveral Orders of Fryers, that have
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95495:34"/>Convents there; who ſung his entry after the Latin way: but were derided by the Greeks that followed them. They have a great many little Churches, both within and without the Town. The beſt is that of Hagia-panda, or All-Saints; which is ſituated in the place leading to the Mole. Its Pappa hath the repute of a learned man, and a good Preacher. He is of Candia, hath a good Study of Manuſcripts, which he brought from thence, and is called Pappa Agapito.</p>
            <p>That of Saint Nicolo likewiſe is well furniſhed with the offerings of Seamen, and is ſituated upon the Mole.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Church of Saint Helias lieth above the Town, on the right hand of the way leading to the Cittadel. It is a pretty pleaſant place, ſet round with Orange-trees; and is beſide remarkable for the fame of Cicero's Tomb, which (as ſome have written) hath been found there, with an Inſcription upon it, mentioning him, and his Wife Tertia Antonia; whereof now there remains nothing but the bottom of an Urn of Porphyry. Nor could we learn what was become of the reſt; there being none at Zant ſo curious concerning the antiquity of their Country, as at Corfu.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Towards the point that lieth oppoſite to Cephalonia is a little Greek Church, called Santa Veneranda, about which the Engliſh uſed formerly to bury their dead; but ſince upon ſome diſpute with the Pappa, they have lately altered their place of burial; it being made a mile or two off the Town, at a little Church in the Plain behind the Caſtle. At the firſt are ſeveral Monuments of our Engliſh Merchants, who have left their Bodies there; but few marks of their Religion are to be obſerved, whether of the living, or the dead, in this, and in ſeveral other of our Factories abroad; to the great diſhonour of the Reformed Religion; there being none to adminiſter comfort to their Souls, by preaching the Word, or adminiſtring the Sacraments to them, when they are in health, or in the greateſt extremities of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and death. For they have neither Church, Chappel, nor Prieſt. So that they ſeem to the people of the place to live without Religion, and to dye without hope, as they really are buried without decency. This is a very great ſcandal to thoſe without; and therefore a very great fault in thoſe within our Church. You ſhall no-where ſee a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory of the Roman Religion, but they will have one, or more Prieſts, when, perhaps, they are not well able to maintain themſelves. But ours on the contrary are rich, wealthy, and able to maintain many; but will keep none. I commend the piety of one of our Countrymen there; who, although he be not too great a friend to our Churches Diſcipline, yet hath offered to pay his proportion to the maintenance of a Prieſt of our Church, and to be his Auditor. But although this be the real fault of this and ſuch other of our Factories; yet becauſe it gives occaſion of reflection upon our Church, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Religion we profeſs, to its ignorant or malicious enemies abroad; it would, in my opinion, be a matter highly becoming the pious Zeal of our Reverend Fathers, to whom God hath committed the care of his Church, to conſider of ſome proper Expedients, if any may be found, to prevent ſuch Scandals, and ſupply the defects of this nature in Foreign Countries, with whom we have any, although but ſmall Commerce.</p>

            <p n="3">3. There was, at that time indeed, at Zant an Athenian, called <hi>Demetrio Bernizelo,</hi> who hath the reputation of the Learned'ſt Man amongſt the Greeks. He underſtands the ancient Greek and Latin well, as alſo the Modern Greek and Italian, hath ſtudied Philoſophy and Divinity, and is permitted to preach, though he be not in Orders.

            <p>This is now the chief Iſland from whence the Currans come, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we make ſo many pleaſant diſhes here in England. They borrowed their name from Corinth, the famous City near the Iſthmus of Morea, and are therefore called in Latin <hi>Uvae Corinthiacae,</hi> or Grapes of Corinth. But none of them now grow there; being (perhaps) neglected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have no Vend for them; the Turkiſh jealouſie permitting no great Ships to enter into that Gulph. They grow not upon Buſhes, like our red and white Currans, as is vulgarly thought: but upon Vines, like other Grapes; only their leaf is ſomething bigger, and the Grape much ſmaller than others: They are alſo without ſtones; and in thoſe parts are only red, or rather black. But when I paſſed by Piacenza in Italy, I ſaw White ones of this kind, only differing in colour. They grow in a moſt pleaſant Plain, behind the Caſtle, encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed about with Mountains and Hills, which hemm in the Iſland. This Plain is divided into Vineyards, mixed with Olive, Cypreſs-trees, and Summer-houſes of pleaſure: All which from the Caſtle, and the Top of <hi>Monte di Scoppo</hi> make a moſt pleaſant Proſpect. In Auguſt, when they are ripe, they are laid thin on the ground, until they are dry: then are they gathered together, cleaned, brought into the Town, and put into Ware-houſes they call Seraglio's; into which they are powred through a hole above, until the Room be filled up to the top. By their own weight they cake ſo together, that they are forced to dig them out with piked Irons; and this they call Stirring. When they barrel them up to ſend into theſe Parts, a man getteth into the Fat with bare legs and feet; and as they are brought and powred in, he ſtill keeps a ſtamping and treading of them down, to make them lye cloſe together. They are worth here about Twelve Dollers the Thouſand, or little more or leſs; and pay as much to the State of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice for Cuſtom. The Iſland beareth enough of them yearly to charge five or ſix Veſſels: Cephalonia three or four, and Nathaligo, Meſalongia, and Patras one: of which ſome few are brought down from the Gulph of Lepanto.</p>
            <p>To maintain this Trade, the Engliſh have a little Factory here, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of a Conſul, and five or ſix Merchants. The Dutch have a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul, and one or two Merchants; and the French have a Conſul and Merchant in the ſame perſon. The Engliſh have the chief Trade here; and good reaſon they ſhould: for I believe they eat ſix times as much of their fruit, as both France and Holland do. The Zantiots have not long known what we do with them; but have been perſwaded,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95495:35"/>that we uſe them only to Dye Cloth with; and are yet ſtrangers to the luxury of Chriſtmas Pies, Plum-potage, Cake and Puddings, &amp;c. Amongſt the Engliſh Merchants is Mr. Pendames, to whom I was much obliged; as for other civilities, ſo for his courteſie in ſhewing me the Iſland; and in it one of the greateſt curioſities that I have ſeen any where. It is the Pitch, or Tarr-Fountains of Zant. They are not above ſeven or eight miles from the Town: But we made, I believe, twice as far by Sea. For we had to paſs about, from this Port, a long Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory, ſtretched out toward the Morea, and thence to return to the Port on the other ſide of it. In that Bay are two other little Rocks, or Iſlands; one of which is called Marathroneſa, or the Fennel-Iſland, from the abundance of that Plant, which groweth there, called in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. In it there is only a little Church, with a Caloyer or two, who look to a Woman they pretend is poſſeſſed with a Devil. But, as my companion ſaith, it is a fooliſh one. For it told us, that he was of Joadua, though it could not ſpeak one word of Italian; nor could it tell of what Country we were, or whether Married, or Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelours; nor indeed make any pertinent anſwer, but ſpeak all in Rhime, but little to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The Pitch-ſprings riſe at the foot of an high Mountain, at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of this Gulph, about a hundred paces from the Sea. The Pitch iſſueth out of the Earth, with the water, in Lumps, or Balls, ſometimes as big as an Haſel-nut, ſometimes as a Wall-nut; and riſeth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to the top of the Water; but in a while after doth. It is like other Pitch in colour, but hath a ſtrong ſmell, as near as I could gueſs, like Oyl of Amber. It is firſt ſoft, but by lying in the Sun grows hard. They gather about ninety, or an hundred Barrels thereof yearly: of which the State hath every Tenth, which they ſave as it riſes, and Barrel it up, and the owners ſell the reſt for two Gazets the pound, which is not a half-peny Engliſh. When the Wind blowed Weſt, that is, over the Mountain, at the foot of which this Spring lieth to the Eaſt; and when there are Earthquakes, it Vomiteth forth this Pitch in greater abundance, than at other times. Whence one may conjecture, that ſome ſubterraneous fire is the cauſe of it; which feeding upon ſulphureous and bituminous matter; what by reaſon of its ſmall Vent it cannot devour, it ſends forth in this black ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. The manner, that I have ſeen Pitch made, confirms me in this opinion: which is thus. They find ſome bank of ground, wherein they dig a hole about two yards Diameter at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e top, but very narrow at the bottom; into which they put the Wood of Pines, chuſing the moſt ſappy, and cleaving them into ſmall ſplints; then place them an end, one above another, until the hole is full. When this is done, they ſet all on fire at the top, which by the Wood burneth ſtill down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and as it burneth, the Pitch diſtilleth to the bottom; and ſo by a little hole is ſaved as it iſſueth forth. Thus may this great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain be compared to a great Pitch-pit.</p>
            <p>In the Duke of Modena's Dominions, not far from his Country-houſe of Pleaſure, but nearer a Village called Saſſolo, is a Mountain named Zebio, that ſometimes burneth out in a light flame at the top. like that of Veſuvius and Aetna, but not with any great fierceneſs.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95495:36"/>At the top is no hole to be ſeen, but only a place about a yard Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, filled with a muddy water, which continually boileth up in bubbles, ſometimes only of air, ſometimes of water, ſtreaked with a greaſie, and ſutty-colour'd ſubſtance. This Water is of a white muddy colour of it ſelf, like the Soil of the Mountain, which is of a whitiſh Freeſtone for the moſt part. At the foot of this Mountain are two Springs of Oyl; the one of a reddiſh, and the other of a clear colour, like ordinary Oyl. Of this great part ſweateth out of the Rock, and part iſſueth out with Water, and is called <hi>Petrolium</hi> in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, and <hi>Olio Diſuſſo</hi> in Italian. Both ſmell alike, although they be not of the ſame colour; and both of the ſame ſmell with this of Zant. The ſubterraneous fire is undoubtedly the reaſon of this; and that it is clearer, and thinner of ſubſtance, may be, by reaſon that it is Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated thorough a more condenſed matter, than that of Zant: But this is not peculiar to hot Countries, for I received lately from Scotland an account of a Well of Oyl, not far from Edenburgh, with a bottle of the ſame Oyl from my Worthy Tutor, Dr. Hicks, Chaplain to his Grace the Duke of Lauderdale. This is of a black colour, like that of Zant, but is thinner; the ſmell neither ſo grateful, nor ſo ſtrong.</p>
            <p>Beſide the Curran-Grapes, whereof I have already ſpoken, and which are now ripe, the Iſland affords other Vines, that yield good, though very ſtrong Wine; but which bears water ſo well, that it may be made as ſmall as Venetian Garbo, and yet better taſted, and as brisk. The red Wine endures the Sea very well; but the Muskatels not; though they are very delicious, and in great plenty here. They make alſo abundance of excellent Oyl; but it is not permitted to be Exported by Foreigners, no more than the Wine: only what the Iſland can ſpare, is ſent to Venice.</p>
            <p>Here are the beſt Mellons (I dare confidently ſay) in the World, if I may compare them with what I have eaten in England, France, Italy, and Turky. They are eſpecially of Two kinds, White and Yellow. The White hath its Pulp of a pale, green colour, and has a perfumed taſte and ſmell, as if they were ſeaſoned with Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greaſe. Their ſhape is not ſo long, or oval, as ours commonly are, but a ſhort, and flat round, in ſhape of a Boul: nor are the Ribs covered with ſuch a Fret work, but ſmooth. The Yellow ones are like the White for ſhape, and are not known from them, until opened: but are not eſteemed quite ſo good. The Peaches here are extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary good, and big, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ghing from ten, to fifteen, or ſixteen Ounces. Here are alſo Citrons, Oranges and Lemons in abundance. One ſort of Lemon is very extraordinary, and ſeldom ſeen in England. For beſide their largeneſs, and thinneſs of skin, filled with excellent ſharp juice, they are without either ſeed, or ſtone. Here are alſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of curious Plants.</p>
            <p>The curious Plants I here took particular notice of, are theſe:
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Geniſta, ſeu Spartium,</hi> a ſmall ſhrub, growing on the Cliffs, bearing many Silver-colour'd leaves, on little Twigs; which are ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with a knot of ſmall Golden flowers; whoſe little cod, or ſeed,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95495:36"/>being paſs'd, the twigs that remain become ſharp thorns.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Convolvulus,</hi> with a large purple flower, and leaves like <hi>Sagit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taria,</hi> or <hi>Arrow-head.</hi> This I found among the Pitch-Springs.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Prunella Spinoſa.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. <hi>Coris Matthioli.</hi> G. 544.</item>
                  <item>5. <hi>Goſſipium.</hi> Here I firſt ſaw the Cotton Plant grow; which is an Annual lant, ſown in Fields, as we do Hemp and Flax; but altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unlike them. It hath a Stalk a foot high, beſet with leaves like Maple, divided into three, ſometimes four parts; from among which leaves come yellow flowers, like Mallows, or Holly-hacks in ſhape, ſet in a cup, conſiſting of three green leaves, nipped about the edges. This, the flower being paſt, filleth it ſelf up with a ſhell, like a Nut, crouded full of Cotton, with two or three round ſeeds in it.</item>
                  <item>6. <hi>Anagallis Aquatica 3tia Lob.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>7. <hi>Glaux Dioſcordis,</hi> as hath been thought by ſome. It is like <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Burgundiacum</hi> in ſubſtance, and leaves, and the flower alſo ends in branches, but of a blewiſh purple colour: which are ſucceeded by cods, each divided into two or three round, rough, and flat ſhells, joyned to each other; in each of which is a ſeed like a Tare.</item>
                  <item>8. <hi>Ciſtus, Plantaginis folio.</hi> This hath four or five leaves lying flat on the ground, long, hairy, and ſinewed, like the middle kind of Plantan; from which groweth a ſtalk of a foot high, beſet, at ſeveral diſtances, with ſmaller long leaves; at the top it is divided into ſeveral branches of bright, and yellow flowers, with black bottoms. This I found only upon <hi>Monte di Scoppo.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>9. <hi>Lychnis,</hi> with Flowers, ſpeckled, like the Strawberry-pricks.</item>
                  <item>10. A ſmall Plant like <hi>Hyſſop,</hi> or <hi>Savoury,</hi> but thin, and downy, with ſmall tender flowers on the top, like <hi>Geranium,</hi> not divided into leaves, but a certain cup of a reddiſh colour, full of purple veins.</item>
                  <item>11. <hi>Cicerum Creticum.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>July the Twenty-eighth, after four days ſtay at Zant, we went aboard again our former Ship, called the Guerriera Coſtante, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Captain Zoane Bronze, Native of Peraſto, a Town in Albania. He was formerly a Pirate, and for his Valour well known, and feared by the Turks, and reverenced by the Corſairs. He is eſteemed one of the ſtouteſt Soldiers the State of Venice hath in its ſervice. They tell of him, that in his younger days he was at Peraſto, on a time when it was aſſaulted by a party of Two thouſand Turks, and they in the Town not above Fifty-nine perſons: yet for all that they made ſuch vigorous reſiſtance, that they ſlew a great part of the Turks, razed their Batteries; and in concluſion, made ſuch a Valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Excurſion upon them, as made them deſiſt from their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</p>
            <p>By a North-wind we put out, and left the Promontory <hi>di Scoppo</hi> on the right hand; but not without ſaluting the holy Image on the top of it, for luck ſake. Not long after we paſſed the Iſles Strophades, called now Strovadi, or Strivalli, thought by the ancient Poets to be the refuge of the Harpies. They are judged about Fifty miles from Zant, and Thirty from the Morea, very low, and the biggeſt not above
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95495:37"/>Five miles in circuit: Nevertheleſs they report, that there is ſuch plenty of freſh water there, that one cannot thruſt a ſtick into the ground, but water guſheth out in the place; which makes them very fertile. They alſo ſay, that in the Fountains of this Iſle are often found Plane-tree leaves; though none grow upon the place, but only in the Morea: which makes them believe, and not without reaſon, that their Original is from thence, and by ſubterraneous Channels they are brought thither. Here is a Covent of about fifty, or ſixty, Greeks in it; who defend their miraculous Madonna, by ſeveral Baſtions, planted with good Canons, for fear of the Corſairs; though they ſay, the very Turks of Barbary have a reſpect for thoſe Reverend Fathers, and ſeldom put a ſhore here, but to take in freſh water. For great Ships they report it to be inacceſſible, except in very moderate and calm weather; there being ſo many Flats about it, and no ſhelter for them.</p>
            <p>About Threeſcore miles further we doubled the Cape Sapienza, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently called on the Weſt-ſide Coriph Promontorium, on the Eaſt Acriti Promontorium; before which lie, in a row, the little Iſlands Sapienza, Carrera, and Venetica, well known to the Pirates of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary, who uſe to skulk with their Veſſels behind them, attending the Barques that come out of the Gulph of Venice, and others which they can maſter, bound that way for the Levant. We were not far from theſe Iſlands, paſſing the Gulph Corone, called formerly Sinus Meſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacus, when a Saylor from the Main-top-Maſt made Ten Sail of great Ships, ſteering the ſame courſe as we did. Upon this we fired a Gun to give notice to the Commander of our Diſcovery, hoiſting and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ten times our Enſign, to denote the number of Sail. He imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſpared Sail, and made as little way as was convenient, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering a fair Nor-Weſt Wind; which we had almoſt a poop. The like we did, and with all ſpeed prepared for an Engagement; knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down all the Cabbins, and throwing Cheſts and Hammocks into the Hold. They loaded the Guns, put out the waſt-cloaths, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Soldiers in their ſeveral Poſts, being as yet uncertain, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were friends, or enemies. They ſuſpected them to be Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, or ſome other Fleet of African Pirates. Some feared they were French-men, in whom they had no great confidence; becauſe they had lately denied ſome of the French Kings Ships, coming from Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſina, liberty to take in Proviſion at Zant; and therefore they knew not how it might be reſented. However, whether Friends, or Enemies, they thought it not ſafe to truſt either, whereby they might be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized. It was three hours before they came up to us, although they made all the Sail they could: which made us believe, that they were either Dutch or Engliſh Merchant-men, (feeing they were ſo flow) and not Pirates, or Men of VVar; who uſe to be better Sailers. But at length, when they came nearer, we diſcerned them to be Hollanders by their Enſigns, which were ſtriped of Blew, VVhite, and Red. Thus all our great preparations for fight ended in amicable ſalutes to each other, expreſſed by ſound of Trumpets, Drums, and Cannon. Our Admiral carried the Banner of Saint Mark upon his Main-Top-Maſt, as Capitan Denavi; which is the higheſt Charge at Sea under
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95495:37"/>this State. And therefore it fell to the Hollanders ſhare to come by our Lee, and ſalute firſt. Their Admiral was young <hi>De Ruiter;</hi> who only as Vice-Admiral of that Squadron, carried his Flag on the Top-Maſt head. His Ship paſſed firſt, and all the reſt in order after him ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; which we ſtill anſwered with the ſame reſpect. After which <hi>De Ruiter</hi> ſent two Officers to complement the <hi>Capitan Denavi;</hi> and ſo took leave of us.</p>
            <p>We were becalmed that night, ſo that we found our ſelves next morning in the ſame Gulph ſtill oppoſite to Corone. But a moderate gale ariſing with the Sun, not long after we doubled the Cape Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapan, called in old time <hi>Promontorium Taenarium.</hi> The Bay beyond it is called <hi>Brazza Dimagnio,</hi> from the City <hi>Magnia,</hi> ſituated at the bottom thereof. The Magnoti, who are the Inhabitants of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, are famous Pirates by Sea, and Peſtilent Robbers by Land. They have always bravely defended themſelves againſt the Turks, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their Liberty, till lately by this ſtratagem the Turks were too hard for them. They got their conſent to build two Forts upon their Coaſts; which they did ſo advantageouſly, as ſoon made them Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of their City, and them. And now none of them are exempted from paying Tribute, but a few in the Mountains. And ſome have quit their Country, and are retired into Ponglia, where the King of Spain hath aſſigned them an habitation. They are naturally ſuch Thieves, that when any Veſſel cometh into their Harbour, they will go by night, and cut the Cables of their Ships, when they can find nothing elſe to lay hold of; which ſometimes endangers the Veſſels running a ſhore, when not diſcover'd in time. Some Mariners of this place, that were on board of us, gave us this account of their Country, with many diverting Stories of the ſame nature; which they glory in. One of the Officers of our Ship, who had been at the Town, related a Story, that well expreſſeth their Thieving nature. Some ſtrangers being at one of the Villages of theſe Magnoti, cauſed their Baggage to be brought into an old Womans houſe, whilſt they baited them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their Horſes: But ſoon after their Hoſteſs fell bitterly a weeping. The ſtrangers ſurprized at it, began to enquire the reaſon. Then one of them anſwering for her, ſaid, That perhaps it was, becauſe the ſight of other Country-men put her in mind of the miſerable eſtate of the Magnoti were reduced unto. But ſhe made them this ſhort reply, and told them <hi>it was falſe; her weeping was becauſe her Son was not at home, to rob them of their baggage.</hi> Such pleaſant Conferences as theſe made our time ſeem leſs tedious, whilſt our ſlow paſſing of this Gulph made it the Fourth day from Zant to Cerigo.</p>
            <p>Cerigo hath the Morea North of it,<note place="margin">CERIGO.</note> and was called anciently Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaera; famous for being the Native Country of Venus and Helena: So that were we to frame an Idea of this place from the fame of theſe Beauties, we might imagine it one of the moſt charming places of the World. But, on the contrary, the greateſt part of it is a barren, rocky, and Mountainous Soil, ill peopled, and can brag of no plenty, neither of Corn, Wine, nor Oyl: which undoubtedly made Venus change her own Country for Cyprus; and Helena ſo willing to be ſtollen and carried into the pleaſant Plains of the Continent. What
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95495:38"/>Beauties it now produceth, I am ignorant of; for I remember not that I ſaw a Woman there. Its plenty conſiſts in Mutton and Fowls, as Turtles (Venus beloved Birds) Quails and Partridges. Abundance of Hares and Falcons breed here; but the people, for what I could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, addict not themſelves to Hawking.</p>
            <p>The chief Town and Fort lieth on the South-ſide of the Iſland, ſtrong only towards the Sea; on which it looketh from a Precipice. Under it is a Harbour, but open to the Southerly VVinds. Upon our entry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Port, whether by neglect, or unskilfulneſs of our Captain, we ran foul of another Ship of our company; and if we did not endanger, did at leaſt conſiderable damage to both. It hath, about three or four miles South, a little Rock, called the <hi>Ovo,</hi> or Egg; the top of which they ſay is covered with Scorzonera, and is inhabited only by Falcons, that breed there. From the Fort alſo is to be ſeen Cerigotto, another little Iſland, inhabited only by VVild Goats. It belonged to Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Macarioti, who ſerved in Candia, before it was taken. He is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to have behaved himſelf at that Siege very gallantly. He made us taſte of very good VVine of Cerigo, where he now liveth. From Cerigo, in clear and fair weather, Candia may be ſeen beyond Ceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotto.</p>
            <p>This Iſland is ſtill under the Dominion of the Venetians, who ſend a Proveditor thither.</p>
            <p>Our Veſſel parted hence before the reſt, to take in freſh water at Port Saint Nicolo, which lieth on the Eaſt-ſide of this Iſland; and is undoubtedly that, for which Strabo ſaith, <hi>The Iſland hath a good Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;</hi> there being, beſide the Harbour for great Veſſels, a natural Creek in the Rocks, large enough for Forty Gallies; which may eaſily be tied together, and ſecured from without with a Chain. Near the Shore here digging, you have very good VVater: which is indeed from a little Rivolet, that in the heat of Summer ſeems perfectly dry in the Channel; but ſtill preſerves it ſelf ſome three foot under the ground. VVe found ancient Ruins near this place; which we took to be the Ruins of Menelaus his City, in old time King of this Iſle. They are almoſt level with the ground. Among theſe Ruins are ſome Grotto's cut out of the Rock; which one of the Iſland pretending to be an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquary, aſſured us were anciently the Baths of Helena; affirming, that her Palace was not above three or four miles from thence on the Hills. VVe took this Antiquary for our guide, and went to ſee what we could find of it. But all we diſcover'd, were two Pillars ſtanding upright, but without Chapitars; and the Baſes ſo deep in the ground, that we could not judge of what order they were. They were neither Chanell'd, nor altogether plain; but their Fuſts cut into Angles, about the breadth of an uſual Channel; and that not the whole length of their Fuſts, but ſome proportionable part only. I rather believe it to have been ſome ancient Temple, than a Palace. They now call the place Paleo-Caſtro, or Old Caſtle. The ſituation of it is ſuch, that it looketh over the beſt part of the Iſland, having a good fruitful Valley on the VVeſt, and another, not barren, on the Eaſt, toward the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. I went up a little higher a ſimpling; but diſcerning the reſt of our Fleet under Sail, and our Ship ready to put out, it not only ſpoiled that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95495:38"/>ſport, but made me like to break my neek, in haſtening down to give my companion notice of it; and for all the ſpeed and diligence we could uſe, we were like to have been left behind. But this haſte ſhall not make me forget to tell, what curious Plants I found upon this Iſland, now I am more at leiſure.</p>
            <p>I heard <hi>Dictamnus Creticus</hi> groweth here; but I found none but <hi>Dictamnus falſus,</hi> they call <hi>de Cerigo,</hi> in great abundance; which differeth from that we call ſo here, though not unlike it. The chief difference is in its Flowers, which are of a purple and white colour, coming out of a wide cup, as broad as a Silver two-pence. The leaves are alſo broader and rounder, and of a very thick hoary ſubſtance. I brought ſeed of it; and it grows in the Gardens of Oxford and Paris. I found two more, which I took to be <hi>Dictamnus Creticus;</hi> but after found my error. The firſt hath a large, thick and woolly Oval-leaf, ſet by pairs on a woolly ſtalk, of a handful high; which ends in a ſpike of ſmall purple flowers, like a kind of Galiopſis, and grows in round bunches together upon the ſides of the Rock. The other I believe to be <hi>Chamaedrys Alpina, minima, hirſuta,</hi> deſcribed the <hi>4th in Prodromo Bauhini.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond kind of <hi>Thymus Capitatus,</hi> differing in the leaves; which are ſmaller, and grow in little Tufts together.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Here is great plenty of <hi>Tragoriganum;</hi> which is a moſt Odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Plant, ſomething like <hi>Winter-Savoury.</hi>

               <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Fifth we parted from Cerigo; and doubling the Cape Saint Angelo, we paſſed within ſight of Malvaſia, a ſtrong Caſtle, built upon a Rock on the ſhore of Morea, or Peloponeſus. Then having paſſed Bella-pola on the right, or, as ſome call it, Iſola Brugiata, (becauſe blown up, and burnt not many years ſince by ſubterraneous fires) and Carabia on the left: (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is a much as to ſay the Ship-Iſland.) We left on our right hand Antemilo, and further off Milo, which is reported to have one of the beſt Ports in the World, and now a refuge for the Corſairs. Afterwards the Wind being North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, we weather'd the Iſle Falconeira; which <hi>Petro della Valle</hi> thinks to be called ſo from the abundance of Falcons breeding there. But they are not ſaid to be more numerous in that place, than in the reſt of the Iſles of the Archipelago. We paſſed in ſight of Argentera, called by the Greeks <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. They ſay, it hath a Mine of Silver, and ſome Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. The name, which the Greeks ſtill retain, ſheweth it to be the ſame, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>; wherein our Modern Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers have been miſtaken, calling ſometimes Polino, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Sicandro, by that name. Afterwards we paſſed by Siphanto; which hath ten Villages, celebrated for excellent Fruits, and beautiful Women. It hath alſo a great Monaſtery; where the greateſt part of the Greek Nuns go to initiate themſelves. A great way Eaſtward we diſcerned Paros, Renowned for its excellent White Marble; which after was ſo improved by the excellent Workmanſhip of Phidias and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95495:39"/>Praxitiles; that of a Rock it became the objects of their Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and honoured with the names of their falſe Gods. It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently dedicated to Bacchus, becauſe of its plenty of excellent Wines; which there is not worth above a Shilling the Barrel. With this Iſland Monſieur Nantuille, then Embaſſador for the King of France, was extremely pleaſed, and gave us, when we waited on him, a very good account, and an excellent Deſcription thereof. But that which I retain beſt in memory, is the account he gave of the Grotto's under the Marble-Mountains there: eſpecially of one, which openeth on the Weſt-ſide of the Rocks, and whoſe entrance ſeemeth to have been by art hewen out of the Marble. It is three ſquare within, and hath about the Walls ſome Inſcriptions; but ſo defaced, that nothing can be made of them. Streight forwards, within this, is another little entrance, leading downwards; ſpacious within, but dark; which by Candle and Torch-light, preſented to their view one of the moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Scenes he ever beheld in all his Travels: and the more ſurprizing, in that it was the ſole contrivance, and workmanſhip of nature; <hi>viz.</hi> the Figures of all ſorts of Woods, Groves, Trees, Pillars, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Poetical phanſies, formed by the falling drops of water congealed into Marble, of a ſudden preſenting themſelves to his ſight, as if en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted into this order by the harmonious ſound they make in falling.</p>
            <p>Some few paces within this Grotto is a place, faſhioned like an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, with ſeveral lovely Scenes behind it, riſing by degrees higher and higher, till they lead the proſpect inſenſibly out of ſight. Here he cauſed High Maſs to be celebrated according to the Rites of the Roman Church, with Muſick, and the ſound of Petarrs inſtead of Cannon: which made ſo horrible a noiſe, in that hollow place, as ſeemed far to out-do the loudeſt Thunder, both for the report, and continuance, having ſo little Vent to diffuſe it ſelf. The Conſecration of this place he cauſed to be Engraven on the Rock in Latin Verſe.</p>
            <p>The Air is here ſo good, that a Noble Venetian, called Antonio Gigli, who retired thither above Thirty years ago, died there not long ſince, Aged a Hundred and fifteen years: and there is yet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Family Baroci as aged, as ſeveral perſons worthy of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, who have lived in the Iſland, aſſured my companion.</p>
            <p>The Embaſſador brought thence ſeveral ancient Inſcriptions, and placed them in the Wall of his Gardens at Conſtantinople: of which more hereafter. About a Muſquet-ſhot from the Iſland is a Rock; on which remaineth a moſt beautiful Arch of Marble; which is eſteemed to have been the Temple of Bacchus.</p>
            <p>Auguſt the ſeventh we had Seriphos, or, as the Greeks now call it ſhort, Serfo, and our Maps Serphanto, on the right. It hath a Town and an Harbour on the South-ſide, with a Covent of Greek Monks, (which we diſcerned after we doubled the Cape) dedicated to Saint Michael, the Archangel; to whom they attribute many Miracles done there. Here are Mines of Load-ſtones; which nevertheleſs make not the Needle vary, although the Veſſels come very near it. Our Pilot told us, he had tried them, but found them not ſo good, as from other Mines.</p>
            <p>In the Evening, the Wind changing Weſtwards, we paſſed between
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95495:39"/>Thermia and Zea; the firſt of which our Maps call Firmia,<note place="margin">THERMIA.</note> and Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minia; but the Greeks Thermia, from the abundance of Baths, and Hot-ſprings, which iſſue thence in a great abundance: Thermia in Greek ſignifying as much. It is much frequented by the Paralytick, Lame, and many other diſeaſed people, being very Diaphoretick. Their Source is near the Port, called Therma. It hath but two Villages, as our Pilot, who is native of the place, informed us.</p>
            <p>We plied ſtill Northwards, and paſſed between Macroniſa and Suda.</p>
            <p>Monday morning, the Ninth, we approached near Tine,<note place="margin">TENOS.</note> and dropped Anchor about noon in a Bay on the South-ſide thereof; there being no Port on that ſide of the Iſland. Tine was anciently called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as by ſome Medals we found there it appeared; which on one ſide bear the Head of Jupiter Hammon, and on the other a bunch of Grapes,<note place="margin">Med. 15, 16, 17, 18.</note> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noting its plenty of Wine, with theſe Letters <hi>T H.</hi> Another I ſaw at Paris amongſt the King of France's Collections, which had on the one ſide the Head of the Emperor Alexander Severus, and on the other a Trident, wreathed about with a Serpent, with theſe Letters about it,
ΤΗΝΙΩΝ,
becauſe here was a noble Temple dedicated to Neptune; where, as Strabo relateth, the adjacent Iſlands uſed to perform the Ceremonies of their Religious Superſtition.</p>
            <p>The whole Iſland lieth high, being a large heap of Marble Rocks; but in many places covered with a fertile ſoil. On the South-ſhore was its ancient City; where nothing now remains, but two or three houſes, called ſtill <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or the City. Here are ſome ancient Remains, and an Inſcription, which ſheweth it, to have belonged to the Monument of Flavius Evergetes, erected by his Wife. Hence we aſcended near four miles to a pointed Rock, in the middle of the Iſland; whereon now is its chief City and Caſtle. As we paſſed, we took notice of its plenty of Vineyards, Figs and Olives. They ſay they have Corn, but not to ſpare; rather wanting the help of other parts, by reaſon they are ſo very popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; this being now the only Iſland in the Archipelago, that have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended themſelves from the Turks; and the laſt in thoſe parts under the Dominion of the Venetians: with whom the Inhabitants have made this agreement, <hi>viz.</hi> That whenſoever they cannot, or will not protect them any longer, they ſhall be obliged to deliver the Caſtle to the Inhabitants; who are to have the freedom to chuſe whom they will for their Protector.</p>
            <p>There are Twenty-four Villages about the Iſland, which can in time of neceſſity retire commodiouſly to this Caſtle; it being in the midſt of them, and having great advantages of nature to defend it ſelf from any ſudden aſſault: though I believe, ſcarce able to ſtand out a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Siege, for want of Water and Proviſion. The Caſtle is on the higheſt point of the Rock, ſurrounded by the Towns, ſomething lower than it; and not only over-looketh the whole Iſland, but almoſt all the Archipelago: which afforded our curioſity a moſt delightful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the ſame. Hence to the Nor-Weſt we ſaw Andros, beyond that Euboea, now called Negroponte by the Franks; and more We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterly Zea. Beyond that Macroniſa, anciently Helena. At a greater diſtance further we could diſcern <hi>Capo di Colouxi,</hi> anciently called <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montorium Sunicum,</hi> the moſt Southern Promontory of all Attica. We
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95495:40"/>ſaw to the Southward (beſides Thermia, Seriphus, &amp;c.) two Iſlands they now call Sdilles, or the two Deloſes, Rhenea and Delos: to the Weſt Micone.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of Tine employed themſelves in VVorking their own Silk, and that of Andros; but they are no great Artiſts in that Trade. The women knit great part of it into Stockings, and ſell them very cheap. Silk is worth about ſix or ſeven ſhillings the pound. There is plenty of freſh water about the Iſland, although not in the Town; and it did therefore bear the name ſometime of Hydriſſa. The Plants I took notice of more particularly here, were theſe: 1. <hi>Limonium,</hi> or, as Gerard calleth it <hi>Limonion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ger. p 412.</note> 
               <hi>folio ſinuato,</hi> or <hi>Sea-lavender with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented leaves;</hi> where I believe either his Printer, or he is miſtaken, in the naming it <hi>folio ſinuato,</hi> for <hi>caule ſinuato.</hi> 2. Another Thorny ſhrub, which I know not under what ſpecies to rank, unleſs Jacea. It rifeth from the ground in a thick, round buſh, its branches hard and woody, dividing it ſelf ſtill into an infinite number of other ſmall branches, which terminate in Thorns; amongſt which are many jagged leaves of an Aſh colour, and with ſmall ſcaly heads, filled, when blown, with a ſtringy, white flower, in all reſpects like Jacea; but much leſs. It was now in ſeed; but I ſaw it after in flower at Athens, in the Spring of the year. 3. A kind of ſmall Stachys, with ſilver leaves; and 4. a kind of <hi>Geniſta Spinoſa,</hi> with red flowers; which I find not any where deſcribed, or mentioned.</p>
            <p>Our Ships being to ſtay here ſome days, to diſcharge themſelves of the Goods of the new General of this place, who (if I remember rightly) beareth the Title of <hi>General of the Archipelago,</hi> though my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion calleth him only <hi>Proveditore;</hi> and alſo to take in the baggage of his Predeceſſor, who was to return to Corfu with half of our Fleet, we reſolved not to let ſo good an opportunity ſlip, without ſeeing the anciently ſo renowned Iſland of Delos, which we had in view, not above eight, or ten miles from Tine. We hired a Bark with four Oars, and had the company of two other Gentlemen, whoſe curioſity was the ſame with ours. The one was Monſieur Angrand, Nephew to the French Embaſſador at Conſtantinople. The other Monſieur Salli, a Flemmiſh Gentleman; and for our Guide one Signior Nicolo Creſcentio of Tine, D. D. who had ſtudied at Rome, and underſtood the Hiſtory of this Country well, and had often been at Delos, when the antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof were not ſo much defaced as now they are. This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with great civility offered us his company, to ſhew us the Iſland. The Wind being fair, and a brisk gale, we ſoon paſſed over to the Iſle Rhencia, now called Great Delos; being the neareſt, oppoſite to. Port Saint Nicolo, where our Fleet lay: and thence paſſing Eaſtward, we croſſed a little Bay, which, they ſay, is a good Road, large and deep enough for Ships of the greateſt burthen. From the further Cape of it we paſſed a Channel of about half a mile over, (according as Strabo affirmeth it to be) to Delos.</p>

            <p>This Iſland is but ſmall, not exceeding five or ſix miles about,<note place="margin">DELOS.</note> twice as long as broad, lieth low, but rocky, and conſequently barren. It hath the Iſland Rhenia Weſtward; the Southern parts of Micone Eaſt, and the Channel between Micone and Tine to the North. It is utterly diſinhabited now, and called Little Delos, or Zdeli in the plural number, comprehending the Iſle Rheneia: which is a corruption of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which, being not obſerved by Strangers, hath been the occaſion of miſtakes in many Modern names of places in theſe Countries, reported by our late Travellers, Geographers, and Mariners. Now the great reaſon, why it was ſo celebrated among the Ancients was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the reputed Birth-place of Apollo, as Pindar, Homer, and Callimachus tell us. In devotion to whom the circumjacent Iſlands, (therefore called the <hi>Cyclades</hi>) to make it the more famous, ſent thither by publick order Prieſts, Sacrifices, and Quires of Virgins, inſtituting there great and publick Solemnities in the praiſe and honour of him. The number of theſe Superſtitious Cyclades, at firſt were but twelve; but afterwards encreaſing, comprehended the greateſt part of the Iſlands of the Aegean-Sea, now called the Archipelago. That Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition reſted not there, but diffuſed it ſelf through Greece, and the moſt Northern Countries beyond, (as from Strabo and Pauſanias in his Attica is apparent) who ſent preſents thither; which by the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who claimed it as their right, were conveyed from the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to this place.</p>
            <p>But the Deſtruction of Corinth by the Romans was the laſt great cauſe of its Riches and Wealth. For becauſe of the convenience of its ſituation, the goodneſs of its Ports, but eſpecially its freedom from all Impoſitions, Merchants flocked thither from all parts.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95495:41"/>Corinth being afterward reſtored, the Athenians gained the Iſland, and were diligent Improvers of its Traffick and Myſteries. A Monument of which I ſaw at Conſtantinople, written upon a Marble brought from thence, by the Marqueſs of Nantell,

            <p>It is a Panegyrick in praiſe of one Patron, Son of Dorotheus, who had done ſeveral good Offices for the Company of the Tyrian Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Mariners, ſpoken by the Chief Prieſt in the Temple of Apollo, at a Meeting there, the Eighth of the Month Elaphebolion, the Year when Phaedrias was Archon of Athens, decreed and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Commons of Athens, and the Company of the Tyrian Merchants and Seamen. But this its Greatneſs and Glory being long ſince obſcured, it now remains, that I give you an account of its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent miſerable condition.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing that we met with, at our arrival to a little Bay, on the Weſt-ſide near the North-end, was a ſquare Foundation, with eleven Granate Pillars yet ſtanding about and within it, which they of the Iſland call the <hi>Schools,</hi> from a Tradition, that there were Schools anciently in that place. Not above a ſtones caſt from thence,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95495:42"/>more Southward, in a large oval Foundation, we found the Pedeſtal of a Statue dedicated to Mithridates Evergetes, in the time that Seleucus (of Marathon) was Gymnaſiarch, or chief Governour of the Schools.</p>
            <q>
               <p>ΒΑΣΙΛΕΟΣ ΜΙΘΡΑΔΑΤΟΥ

            </q>
            <p>Which would have ſerved to have confirmed the vulgar Tradition of the firſt Ruin, had we not found another to the ſame effect, though differing in name, a great way from it; wherefore they ſerve only to prove, that there was a <hi>Gymnaſium</hi> in Delos. But this oval Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation we judged to have been a <hi>Naumachia,</hi> or place to exerciſe Naval Recreations in; and the rather, that our Doctor <hi>Creſcentio</hi> told us, that he remembred to have ſeen a Hole in the middle of it, which probably might have been to let in the Sea-water, ſeeing it lieth low enough, and not far diſtant from the Sea. It is about three hundred paces in length, and two hundred in breadth; and the Wall about four or five foot from the bottom, but even with the Ground above. Some Pillars yet remain ſtanding on the brink of it, which made us conclude, that there had been a Portique about it, either for Uſe, or Ornament, or for both. This ſeemeth to be that which the Poet Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus calleth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or the <hi>Round Lake;</hi> for his Scholiaſt, in the Explication of the Place, ſaying, <hi>that it may be underſtood of the Sea, becauſe it encompaſſeth the Iſland,</hi> addeth, <hi>that perhaps there was a round Lake therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Proceeding yet more Eaſtward, we came to a vaſt heap of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable white Marble, which we knew to have been the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> by the Trunk of his Statue we found among them. This goodly ſtructure is ſo entirely ruin'd, that it is impoſſible to judge of its form, and the God himſelf ſo ill handled, that he hath neither hands, feet, nor head left him; yet what is remaining appeareth ſtill moſt beautiful; his locks hanging round his ſhoulders are yet to be ſeen, having marks in each curl (as we judged) where Jewels had been ſet, with a ſign about his waſte of a Girdle, which had in like manner been richly adorned, and on his left ſhoulder a light Mantle. The Statue was above four or five times bigger than Nature, and no leſs than a Coloſſus; for the ſhoulders are ſix foot broad, and the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts of the body proportionable. The beauty of it is ſuch, that I am apt to believe, if Michael Angelo had ſeen it, he would have admired it as much as he did that Trunk in the Vatican at Rome. It ſtood upon his Pedeſtal upright, until about three years ago (as Signior Georgio, our Landlord at Micone, informed me) an Engliſh-man who was there, call'd, as he ſaid, Signior Simon, Captain of the Saint Barbara, endeavoured to carry it away, but finding it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he brake off its head, arms, and feet, and carried them with him. But here I muſt obſerve, that my Note differs from Monſieur <hi>Spon</hi>'s, Tom. 1. p. 180. who ſaith it was a <hi>Venetian.</hi> A little further, among theſe Ruins, we found the half body of a Woman, the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95495:42"/>Drapery about which was carved ſo well, that it ſeemed to be the work of no leſs a Maſter than the former. Juſt by this, was the body and forepart of a Centaure, ſo admirably well cut alſo, that life and vigour appear'd in every Vein and Muſcle: Upon his back appear'd a place cut, as we ſuppoſe, to ſet a ſedent Figure in; whence we judged, that it might have been the Centaure Neſſus, who would have committed a Rape on Deianira; which was no improper Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to this Temple, Centaurs being conſecrated to Apollo, as is to be ſeen in many Medals; eſpecially of Gallienus, one of which I found at Smyrna of a mixed Metal, whoſe reverſe hath a Centaure holding a Globe in its right hand, pierced behind with a Dart, and theſe Letters about it, <hi>APOLLINI CONS. AUG.</hi> Not far from theſe, we found other Fragments; one piece was the head and neck of an Horſe; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which ſeemed to belong to the ſame part of the Bodie of a Horſe, with a Fragment of a ſedent Figure of a Woman, from the feet almoſt to the waſt upon it, the hinder part of the Figure ending like a Fiſh with ſcales. I cannot well determin, whether the upper part of the Woman I before mentioned belongeth to the Centaure, or this. Theſe all ſeem to have been the Ornaments of the walls of the Temple, and of the ſame manner of work in entire Relievo.</p>
            <p>Here are ſeen alſo four other pieces; which we gueſſed to have been of the Lyons, that the Neighbouring Iſlanders remember to have ſeen formerly here. On the South corner, at the Weſt end of theſe ruins (where perhaps was the entrance of the Temple) is a great piece of Marble hollow in the middle, and almoſt buried in the ground; which perhaps was part of the pedeſtal of the Gigantique Statue of Apollo, becauſe on the one ſide are theſe Letters
ΝΑΞΙΟΙ ΑΠΟΛΛ,
which denote, that it had been dedicated by thoſe of the Iſland Naxos to Apollo. The Letters on the other ſide we could not well tell what to make of; but-upon conſideration they ſeem to me to be Vulgar Greek.</p>
            <p>From the Temple of Apollo directing our ſteps Southward, and near the Weſtern ſhore of the Iſland, we came to the Ruins of a wonderful Portico of Marble; whoſe vaſt Architraves, Pillars, and other the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful parts Bury each other in as great confuſion as time and bad Fortune could reduce them to. Upon one of the Architraves broken in two pieces, we ſound theſe Letters of a ſpan deep
ΒΑΖΙΛΕΩΣ ΦΙΛΛΙΠΠ.
Signior Creſcentio remembers, he ſaw on a Fragment of the ſame Architrave
ΜΑΚΕΔ,
which ſheweth, that Philip of Macedon was its Founder. Further upon a little eminence among other Marbles we found theſe Letters alſo, upon an Architrave:
ΔΙΟΝΥΣΙΟΥ ΕΥΤΥΧΟΥ,
Dionyſius the Son of Eutyches, another Grecian King. The Pillars were Angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar towards the Baſe, and channel'd upwards, being of ſeveral pieces, and of the Corinthian order, as appeared by their chapetes; of which we found only three or four.</p>
            <p>Not far from the South end of this Portique, and on the Weſt ſide of a little rocky Mountain, which undoubtedly was the Mount Cynthus, is a Theater. It is ſomething more than a Semicircle, whoſe Diameter comprehending the ſeats, and utmoſt wall is about two hundred Foot; on each ſide without its Circumference, are the Foundations of a Tower
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95495:43"/>Thirty Foot long, and Eighteen broad: Before the Scene are eight, or nine Vaults in a row, anſwering Parallel to the Diameter of the Theater; ſeparated from each other by a wall, in which is a little Arch, ſerving for a paſſage from one to another. Theſe ſome of us took for Ciſterns to hold water; and others for Caves, to keep wild Beaſts in, uſed to be baited in the Theaters of the Ancients, ſomewhat reſembling our Bear-gardens: The whole Fabrick is of white Marble, and each Stone on the outſide cut in the form of a Diamond. In the place of the Spectators there are ſome ſeats ſtill remaining: The whole Theater leaneth on a hill, part of which ſeemeth to be dug away to make room for it.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>From the Theater Eaſtwards, paſſing over a world of Ruins, we began to aſcend the high Rock, called anciently Mount Cynthus: Which can be called high only in reſpect of the other hills in this Iſland, and not in reſpect of the circumjacent Iſles, which are beyond proportion higher. It is very craggy and ſteep, and conſiſts of a Granate Marble, of ſeveral colours; ſome reddiſh mixed with black, others lighter; other ſome yellowiſh, with black ſpots, and ſome a light grey. It is very hard, but I doubt endureth not the weather ſo well, as that of Egypt. For the Pillars at the Schools I but now mentioned, ſeem to be of the ſame ſtone, and are very much ſcaled by the weather: This makes me doubt, whether all the Pillars, that are ſeen in ſo many places, be of the Granate of Egypt. For although Monſieur Spon took no notice, where any ſtone hath been dug out of it; yet I believe the way up the Mountain, (which is deep, broad, and winding) was the quarry, where much of that Marble had been taken; for it reſembles many quarries I ſaw afterwards in the Mountain Pentelicus in Attica: Beſides, they would not have beſtowed the pains to have dug ſo deep only for a way, nor is it apparent that it
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95495:43"/>was the way: For on the Right hand, as we aſcended up a little diſtance from it, is a Port, or Gate, made of ſuch vaſt ſtones, as I believe were dug not far from the place, which was the entrance to go up to the Caſtle on the top of the hill; where yet remain Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of White Marble. Another quarry of ſuch ſtone is on the Alpes, near Lago-Maiore; with Pillars of which the Frontispieces of moſt of the Churches in Millain are Beautified: And I believe thoſe of Spalato may come from ſome quarrie in the Mountains of Croatia, as I before hinted. This ſide of the hill hath aſcents one above another, diſtinguiſhed by Walls on each ſide of the place, ſuppoſed to have been the way up: Which have been wonderfully Beautified with Porticoes, or Cloyſters, and other Buildings; as the abundance of Pillars, Pedeſtals, Architraves, and other Fragments of excellent Marble, ranging ſtreight and Parallel to each other, do ſufficiently teſtifie: There are few Chapitels of Pillars to be ſeen here, or any where in the Iſland; becauſe their Beauty made them eſteemed worth carrying away.</p>

            <p>Among theſe ruins we found an Altar dedicated to Serapis, Iſis, Anubis, Harpocrates and the Dioſcouri; who perhaps had a Temple there, though not mention'd by Ancient Authors; or at leaſt an Altar in ſome other Temple. For here was one dedicated to Latona, the Mother of Apollo; which Strabo calleth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and another of Hercules, as appeareth by the Inſcription of Patron, under the Archontſhip of Phaedrus, which I but now cited. The chief City of this Iſland reacheth from Mount Cynthus Northwards, to the ſtreight between the Iſland Rheneia, and the place where we here firſt put aſhore, and ſaw the Gymnaſium: For the ruins are continued ſo far in length, and from the Sea Weſtwards near half the breadth of the Iſland: From the top of this Mountain I took the proſpect of it; with its other hills and ruins, as I have here deſigned it.</p>
            <p>In the evening we return'd to our Boat, purpoſing to get to our Veſſel that Night; but we found the Sea ſo rough, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be done; and therefore the Boat being drawn aſhore with Stoechas Citrina, and our Quilts that we brought for fear of ſuch an accident, we took our Lodging up that Night, in hopes of a calm in the Morning: But the next day the wind was as high as before; yet we reſolved to trie to get out, and keeping under the Lee ſhore, to croſs over to Micone. Nevertheleſs, ſo ſoon as we were got out of the little harbour, the Sea running ſo high, that it had almoſt daſh'd our Boat againſt a rock, we were forced to put into the next Bay Northward
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95495:44"/>of the former, and there draw our Boat aſhore, and expect in God's good time a fairer opportunity. We had not only bad weather by Sea, but alſo a diſtreſs aſhore to ſtruggle with; being in a barren and deſert Iſland, almoſt deſtitute of all ſorts of Proviſions, Victuals, Wine and Water: In this perplexity we went to the top of a ſteep rock, which makes the Northern Cape of the Iſland, there to cheriſh our hopes with the ſight of our Fleet; from which we expected our relief. But to our amazement, and the increaſe of our ſorrows, we perceived them to be under Sail, and our ſelves like to be left behind: Yet were our troubles ſomewhat alleviated, when we ſaw, that our Ships (the current running ſtrong between Tine and Micone, and the wind contrary) could not paſs that way, but were forced to bear over, and come to Anchor at Micone. Our proviſions at this time were reduced to one Penny Loaf, and two or three Morſels of Biſquit, our water was ſpilt, and not an Engliſh pint of Wine left: nor knew we of any Water in the Iſland; we had ſearched before, but in vain, for the River Inopus, which Strabo mentions to have been in this Iſland; but now to be found no where, and perhaps it was only a torrent after ſome great Rain; or ſome little brook, that the heaps of ruins now keep hid; or elſe it riſeth in ſome part ſo near the Sea-ſhore, that it ſcaped our moſt diligent ſearch; unleſs it be in one place, which I ſhall hereafter mention. In a word we had no ſpade nor any other Inſtrument to dig, and find freſh water with: Thus penſive, and melancholy we ſeparated, and went ſeveral ways to entertain our ſelves with ſolitary Contemplations. I fetched a walk towards a hill, on the North-eaſt Corner of the Iſland; which we had not before ſearcht: It is near as high as Mount Cynthus; on the top whereof are the Foundations of the Wall of a ſquare Town, or Caſtle, Foſſed without, but not very deep: From whence below in the Valley, Eaſtward, I diſcovered many Ruins, Foundations, and Pillars, which we had not yet ſeen: As I deſcended, going along by the ſide of the hill, that I might ſee all with more eaſe, I found two Ciſterns, but without water: The one was newly dried, as by the mud at the bottom appeared; from it goeth a ditch to the Ruins; beyond which, by the Sea-ſide, on a riſing ground is a Foundation, with ſome Pillars ſtanding, and others down; perhaps it hath been a Portico to ſome other great Building. This is the moſt pleaſant, and fruitful part of the Iſland: Two ſtones-caſt from this, Weſtward and South of the Iſle, are the Foundations of two Temples; in one of which I found a Pedeſtal of a Statue dedicated to Mithridates Eupator, Son of Mithridates Evergetes, erected by Dionyſius Neſanus, an Athenian, who was that time Gymnaſiarch. The firſt was that famous King of Pontus, who made War with the Romans for ſo long a time,<note place="margin">Ibid. Mac. VIII.</note> and was at laſt defeated by Pompey. Mithridates Evergetes, the Father, was a Friend and Allie of the Romans. This place I believe to have been the New Athens at Delos; of which the Inſcription in Saint Marks Library at Venice makes often mention, and is Printed in Gruterus, <hi>Page</hi> CCCCV. the Community whereof, I think likewiſe ſubſcribed to the Inſcription of that ſtone, which was erected to the honour of Patron. This Town was Built at the charge of the Emperour
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95495:44"/>Adrian, by the Athenians, and called New Athens; which in all probability was the place Stephanus Byzaut ſaith, was before called Olympoeum in Delos. One of the Temples there might be that of Hercules, mentioned in the Inſcription of Patron, and ſet in that Temple; and the other that of Neptune. In the celebration of thoſe Sacrifices Patron's was to be yearly Crowned with a Golden Crown; and whither it is not improbable, but that a chanel might have come from the Ciſterns to ſupply water for the publick ſervice, and other uſes in his Temple. I know not, whether I may properly call that a Ciſtern I now ſpeak off; for perhaps it may ſometimes be a ſpring making the River, Inopus; which had its overflowings like the Nile: for the place ſheweth no art, but meerly a deep bed; where I perceived water had been: But whether ſaved there by Rain, or by riſing out of the Earth, I cannot tell; yet the time of the year ſeemed to argue againſt the former, it being in the heat of Summer, when little Rain falls in thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>After I had ranged over this corner of the Iſland with ſome ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction (though penſive enough, when I thought how miſerable we were like to be, if the weather ſtaied us, untill our Ships were gone) I returned to take my ſhare of that little proviſion we had left; which we divided, with all the Geometry we had, into equal parts; wherewith though we filled not our bellies, yet all ſeemed ſatisfied. The Doctor and one of our Watermen were not yet returned; but we ſaved their parts: But for the next meal we were very ſollicitous, not knowing whoſe turn it might firſt be, to have his haunches cut out, to ſerve for Veniſon to the reſt. Some went a hunting with the Flemmiſh Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which brought his Gun and Dog with him; and found good ſport with the Hares, and Rabbets, in which this Iſland yet abounds, being ſometimes called Lagia for that reaſon. But Monſieur Engrand and I, being weary of our Mornings walks, ſtayed by the Boat, and tried ſome Philoſophical experiments, how to make freſh water; and firſt how the Sea-water would do by paſſing it through ſand; with which we filled our Basket, emptied of proviſions: for I rememb'red I had read ſome ſuch experiment; but this proved without effect. After this we fell a digging on the ſhore, at ſome diſtance from the Sea, with our hands, ſharp ſtones, and the ends of our ſpears 'till we ſcraped ſo deep, that at length we found water but it was ſalt. Our Philoſophy failing, after two or three hours, we return'd to the Boat, hot with the toyl, ſcorched with the Sun, and thirſty with taſting the ſalt water, and ſo in deſpair of relief laid our ſelves down in all the ſhade we could make, under the ſide of the Boat: For here groweth now no Palm-trees, or any other that can make one; committing our ſelves to the mercy of the great Preſerver, as well as Creator of beings. But to loſe no time I began to recollect what Plants I had. ſeen here; Beſides the abundance of Stoechas Citrina I before ſpake of, here groweth Lentiscus, or the Maſtick ſhrub, in great plenty, wild; upon which I obſerved Tears of Maſtick, which made us believe, that if it were cultivated here as well as at Scio, it might bear as well as there.</p>
            <p>Doctor Creſcentio, (who knew that there was water in the Iſland, and therefore reſolved never to give over looking, untill he had found
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95495:45"/>ſome) came within an hour after with this moſt welcome news, that he had ſound a Ciſtern of water; this made us all though Greeks Romans, Engliſh, French, Dutch, and as differing in Religion, as in Country, agree in one to give praiſe to our great Preſerver. Not long after returned our hunters, with a Rabbet and ſome Birds. So all together we went with the Mariners about a mile from thence, to the top of a little hill, to the North-Eaſt of the Iſland; where the ground riſeth a little higher then the Theater, with Ruins round it; and hath on the top of all a little hollow place, wherein is a ſmall hole broken into a large Arched Ciſtern, only big enough for a man to deſcend through by a Rope: For the water is not directly under the hole, but in a further corner not eaſily ſeen, the Ciſtern being much filled with rubbiſh. It proved excellent water. This I have been larger upon than ordinary, leſt ſome whoſe curioſity ſhould lead them thither, may have the ſame need of it, as we had. Having filled all the Veſſels we had, we returned cheerfully to our Boat, to prepare our Veniſon for ſupper; which with a Loaf Monſieur Spon had laid by for a good time, we eat heartily, and with no little ſatisfaction; not doubting, but he that did this, would, when he ſaw it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for us, ſtill the winds, and raging of the Sea alſo. After this we made a great fire on the hill, of Staechas Citrina, and ſuch other combuſtible ſtuff, as we found there, to give notice to our Veſſel, that we wanted help. This done, we laid our ſelves down as the Night before; but with no great mind to reſt: Before day we found the wind much abated, and in effect a calm. Sowe took the opportunity, and put out to Sea; and although it ran high, yet the wind being low, by great providence we paſſed ſafe the Chanel, about four miles over, to the Port and Town of Micone.</p>
            <p>Micone is ſo called by the Franks, and was by the Ancient Greeks, and is yet by the Modern, called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Micone. The Poets fancied this to be the Burying place of the Centaurs, conquered by Hercules: It is not ſo far diſtant from Delos, as Ferrarius in his Dictionary aſſureth; it being but four miles at the moſt. Between it and Delos is a Scoglio, called by the Franks Dragonera, by the Greeks Tragoniſi, that is, the Iſland of Goats. Micone hath a good and large harbour towards the Weſt-ſide of it; is rather bigger than leſſer, then Tine, and may have twenty five, or thirty miles in circumference. It is fruitful in Wine and Corn, eſpecially Barley, and is well peopled, and by Chriſtians only; but now under the protection of the Turks. Their Governour is a Chriſtian, ſent by the Turks from Conſtantinople: Monſieur Bandrond is therefore miſtaken, who hath augmented the Dictionary of Ferrarius, to put it under the Venetians. I had no information, whether it ever were, or when, taken by the Turks: Perhaps it was ſlighted in the War of Candia, becauſe not tenable. For they have but one Town, without any Fortifications by nature, or art; which lieth within the harbour. There is about thirty Greek Churches, and only one Latin in the Town. They pay to the Turk a tribute which he ſendeth for yearly; but as to the true Sum I know not how to decide the difference between my Companions Memoirs, and my Journal. For he ſaith it is Three Thouſand and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95495:45"/>Six Hundred Dollers; but I have noted only that they preſent the Turk, as often as he ſendeth his Gallies, Two Hundred Dollers; beſides the miſchief they ſuffer from them in their Figs and Vineyards. Perhaps the firſt claimed as a duty to the grand Signior; and the laſt only as a preſent to the Carathi; who with great greedineſs extort preſents for themſelves, where ever they come. The greateſt part of the Inhabitants are Pyrats, and this place is a great Staple for their prey: Here they keep their Wives, Children, and Miſtreſſes. The greateſt part of the Town ſeems to conſiſt of Women; who deſervedly have a greater reputation for Beauty then Chaſtity; the Men being moſt of them abroad, ſeeking their Fortunes. Our Captain had here a Seraglio of them, when he was a Corſaire in theſe Seas, as I before mentioned. But thoſe being now antidated, he was for new game at his coming hither; and therefore found out a pretty young Virgin for his Miſtreſs, which he bought of her Brutal Father, as proviſion for his Voyage to Conſtantinople. The Hiſtory of the taking her I will not let paſs without relating it, becauſe I was by accident at the Rape of this fair Helena. The Admiral of our little Fleet, unexpectedly hoiſting Sail, before he had brought her aboard, he ſent his long Boat to fetch her away, by ſome of his truſty Servants: I having left ſomething aſhore where I Lodged, begged leave of the Captain to go with the Boat; which I obtained with ſome difficulty, not imagining the reaſon of their putting aſhore at that time. They went ſtreight to the Captains houſe, while I went to fetch my things: When I returned back to them, I found them very merry, drinking with ſome other Women the Captain had formerly kept; and alſo ſome Pirats, who had been of the Captains Comrades, eſteemed very ſtout Men. One, I remember, was extreamly civil to me, and offer'd me many Favours, I knew not how to accept of; and withall aſſured me, that if he had the fortune to meet me at Sea; that he would treat me with all civility imaginable; for which I thanked him, hoping never to have any need of his kindneſs. Thoſe ſent by the Captain went ſtreight to the houſe of this young one; who with weeping and great ſeeming unwillingneſs, ſuffered her ſelf to be carried to the Boat; whilſt her Mother put the reſt of the Women in the Town in an uproar; who in multitudes followed her to the water-ſide. The Mother ſtood raging on the ſhore, as if ſhe had not known what her Husband had done; whilſt ſome ſtood to look, and others (I Judge) to be looked on: For along the ſhore I believe, above a hundred Girls, from ten or eleven, to fourteen or fifteen years old, ſtood with their Coats as high as their middle (I gueſs to ſignifie they were ready to accompany her, ſo ſoon as occaſion offered:) Thus ſhe was conveyed aboard, and a Cabin built for her, where the Captain could retire to her himſelf, and oblige the reſt of his Friends. He kept the next day a Feaſt, inviting his Officers as to his Nuptials; and had her dreſſed very fine in a Venetian habit. For the Women of Miconie's dreſs is very odd; although they ſeem to become them there: I have cauſed what I deſigned of it, to be cut as here you may ſee.</p>

            <p>Their Hair is twiſted, and tied up ordinarily in a Hair-lace, with Pendants in their Ears; over which, when they go abroad, they wrap a Yellow, Silken Vail, as thin as Tiphany, with the end flying looſe about their ſhoulders. They wear a Bodies of Red or Green Velvet, laced with Silver or Gold lace in the ſeams; out of which come their Arms, in a long and large linnen ſleeve, ſometimes laced, or wrought at the hands, wide at the ends, reſembling a Surplice. About the waſt is a long plaited skirt of Cloth made of Cotton: The thick plaiting ſheweth it to tal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> up ſufficient quantity of ſtuff; under which is another garment of the ſame ſtuff plaited; which reacheth down to their knees. To make this, they ſay, they ordinarily put a hundred yards of Fuſtian; and upon it they wear an Apron, that reacheth not quite ſo low; under which appeareth their ſmock again, reaching as far as the calf of the Leg, embroidered at the edges: And then their Legs and Feet in Cotton ſtockings almoſt to the Toes; which are hid with the top of their ſlippers, covered with Velvet, ſometimes laced with Gold lace.</p>
            <p>Here I ſaw no Monuments of Antiquity; only my Landlord, Signior Georgio, ſold me a Silver Medal of the Country; which had the head, as I gueſs, of Jupiter, with a wreath about it on one ſide, and on the reverſe a bunch of Grapes, and by it the end of a Launce, with theſe Letters MYKO, which aſſureth it to have been there Stamped. The Grapes ſignifie their plenty of Wine; as indeed there is now no
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95495:46"/>want of it, nor of any other proviſion. Wild Foul is there very cheap; a brace of Partridges coſt not ordinarily above a Groat, or Six-pence, although they made us pay Ten-pence, becauſe we were Strangers. If they had plenty of Powder and Shot, perhaps they would be much cheaper. Water and Wood are ſcarce; one great Ciſtern being all, that ſerveth the whole Town.</p>
            <p>Friday, the Thirteenth of Auguſt we parted from Micone, and paſſed between it and Tine. On Saturday Morning we ſaw a far off, on the Right-hand, Nicaria, Anciently called Icaria, famous for the Hiſtory of Icarus, and Daedalus: The North-wind ariſing drove us towards Samos; which we ſaw about Twenty Miles off, Eaſt-wards. Towards the evening we were driven almoſt into the Chanel, between the ſhore of Aſia, and the Iſle Scio: So that we were forced to make a great board, to double the Scoglio Venetico, near to which we paſſed. On Sunday Morning we diſcovered Scyros, and the little Iſle Caloiro; which ſome (miſtaken) take to be Giaros, now called Joura, as before. When one diſcovereth this Iſland a far off, one would think it to be the Sails of a Ship. At Night the wind coming about South-eaſt, we paſſed between the Scoglio Piſara, and the Iſle Scio. The wind continuing yet favourable, we left Metelin the Ancient Lesbos on the Right-hand. On Monday a good freſh gale riſing with the Sun, carried us by Night in ſight of Tenedos: Where two of our Ships, the Jove Fulminante and the Fortunetta, being better Sailers, caſt Anchor; whilſt we were that Night becalmed. The Seventeenth the North-wind roſe again; inſomuch that our Ship was forced to make two great boards to get under the covert of Tenedos, towards the Southern end in the Chanel, between it and the Country of Troy. Here we had ſo little ſhelter from the wind, that we were forced to caſt out two Anchors to reſiſt the ſtream; and the wind by this time was ſo high, that it endangered the Maſt, and rent one of the Sails before it could be furled.</p>
            <p>But before we proceed any further, I will give you an account of ſome other Iſlands in the Archipelago, which we paſſed by, and ſuch other particulars, as we learned from our Sea-men.</p>
            <p>But of Samos, Nicharia, and Patmos, I ſhall ſay nothing ſince Joſeph Georgirenes, Archbiſhop of Samos, hath lately given the World an ample account thereof, Tranſlated out of the Vulgar Greek, by a Learned Divine into Engliſh; to whom I refer my Reader.</p>
            <p>Scio, Anciently Chios, is one of the nobleſt Iſlands in the Archipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lago:<note place="margin">SCIO.</note> It lieth near the Aſian ſhore between Smyrna and Epheſus, is well Inhabited, and Frultful; having one good City, and about a dozen, or fifteen Villages. They cultivate the Maſtick, and Turpentine Trees, and make great advantage of both of them, their Gums being much valued all over Europe. The deſcription of both Trees you may ſee in Gerard, <hi>Page</hi> 1432. they both grow in the Southern parts of France, but produce no Gum there, this place is renowned at preſent for good Wine, and handſom Women, and thoſe very kind. The deſcription you may ſee at large in Mr. <hi>Sands,</hi> who was ſo fortunate as to ſee it. They make there alſo ſome courſe Damaſques; which they ſend into Barbarie: The Iſland hath a very good Harbour, and a good Fort;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95495:47"/>where the Grand Signior keepeth a Garriſon. It hath a bold ſhore round about it; but as to its Circumference I know not how to give my judgment, having had no information in that particular; and Authors diſagreeing: For my Companion ſetteth it down about Sixty Miles; Peitro della Valle Ninety; and our Country-man, Mr. <hi>Sands,</hi> preciſely Sixſcore and five Miles. It looketh very high, and Mountainous from Sea, and ſends down moſt prodigious guſts of wind,<note place="margin">LESBOS.</note> as I experienced returning from Smyrna. Of Lesbos likewiſe he hath given a good deſcription; for it is much bigger then Scio, and hath plenty of Corn, Wine, and Cattle: Of the milk of which they make much Butter and Cheeſe, but have little Trade. Each of theſe Iſlands pay Eighteen Thouſand pieces of Eight a year Carraeth to the Grand Signior. Thoſe that gather it at Scio make the heirs, three years after the death of their Friends, pay it. They ſay alſo when a Greek changeth his habitation, they make him pay a double Pole-Money; one in the Country he left, and another in that where he cometh to live; unleſs they avoid it by ſome Artifice, as by concealing their native place, and true Name. Naxia payeth Six Thouſand Dollers, Milo Three Thouſand, Paros and Auſe as much: Scyros Two Thouſand, Zea Seventeen Hundred for Carraeth, and for Tenths Two Thouſand Five Hundred: Andros Four Thouſand Five Hundred, Carraeth, and Six Thouſand Eight Hundred for Tenths. Negropont, which is the greateſt Iſland in the Archipelago, payeth a Hundred Thouſand Dollers for all its priviledges. The tenths are paid to the Beyes and Vayvodes; who are obliged out of them to keep a certain number of Gallies, without any expence to the Grand Signior. Smyrna maintains two Gallies, Naxia, Meteline, Samos, and Andros, each of them one: Scio two, Micone, and Seripho one; and ſo the reſt in proportion to their Abilities.</p>
            <p>But to return to our Veſſel at Tenedos. This Iſland is about four or five Miles from the ſhore of Aſia, about Twenty Miles in Circuit, and Truitful in Corn and Wine, eſpecially Muskatels; great part of which is carried to Conſtantinople. It hath a Town and a Caſtle, which lieth on the North-end of it; but regarding the Promontory, Sigaeum, towards the Eaſt, now called Janizzari, by the Turks, it was taken by the Venetians in the War of Candia, and retaken by the Turks by means of a good round Sum of Money, given to the Treacherous Governour. Near this place was a famous Sea-fight, fought betwixt the Venetians and Turks, with great loſs on both ſides, though the Victory remained to the Venetians.</p>
            <p>From our Ship at the South-end of Tenedos, we diſcovered the top of that famous Mountain Ida,<note place="margin">TROY.</note> and in the ſame line, upon the Aſian ſhore, vaſt Ruins of a City; which we took to be the ſo much celebrated Troy; and therefore we longed very much to ſee it, nor had we therein our deſires fruſtrated. For, Friday the Twentieth of Auguſt, the wind holding ſtill contrary or calm, both Wood and Water was wanting to our Veſſel; and therefore the long Boat being ſent aſhore for recruits, we cloſed with that opportunity of ſeeing the Valiant Trojans Country. We landed in a plain about three Miles North of thoſe Ruins, which we ſaw from our Ship; where digging
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95495:47"/>in the ſand (I ſuppoſe the hidden Chanel of ſome rivolet) the Sea men found freſh water. This plain is in ſome places tilled, and in ſome places neglected: It beareth Corn, Cotton, and Seſami (of which they make Oyl). Cucumbers and Melons of ſeveral kinds, as Water-Melons, which the Italians call Anguria, and another kind, which they here call Zucchi. I ſaw alſo in many places neglected, Fig-trees and Almond-trees, with Fruit upon them. Here groweth alſo abundance of Oaks, whereof I never ſaw any of the kind in England. It agreeth ſomething with the deſcription Gerard giveth of the Cerris Majore Glande, or the Holme-Oak with great Acorns; but not well with his Figure. It groweth to a large well proportion'd Tree, with a fair top and large branches; but whether it is good Timber, or no, I know not: Its ſmall twigs bear a fair leaf, above as long again as broad, broad at the bottom and ending in a ſharp point, ſnipped about the edges with deep ſharp-pointed teeth, like a great ſaw, and of an Aſhcolour, ſomewhat downy. It beareth an Acorn twice as big as our ordinary Oaks; which cometh out of a deep cup, that covereth half the length of it. It is rough on the outſide, with a long, flat, and heavy ſubſtance; which before the Acorn appeareth, is like to thoſe great excreſcences, that ſometimes are ſeen in the ſpring upon our young ſappy Oaks.</p>
            <p>In this walk I ſaw other curious Plants, as 1. Tragacantha,<note place="margin">PLANTS.</note> out of which Gumme Dragon iſſueth in ſome places: 2. Paſtinaca Echi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifera, Fabij Columni: 3. Jacea Lutea, Capite Spinoſo: 4. Tarton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reina Maſſilienſium, of two kinds, Longifolio &amp; Latifolio: 5. Papaver Caniculatum, horned Poppies, whoſe Flower is black at the bottom, fomewhat higher, of a deep red, and by degrees end in a Golden Colour: 6. Pancraſium in Flower: 7. Verbaſcum Marinum, laciniatis Folijs. So that I cannot with Mr. <hi>Sands,</hi> call this barren ground, but neglected: 'With theſe curioſities I entertained my ſelf whilſt the reſt of our Company diverted themſelves with the game they found in great plenty there; as Hares, red Partridges, Quails, Turtles, and a Bird about the bigneſs of a Thruſh, the head and breaſt of a bright yellowiſh colour, the back and wings of a greeniſh grey, like a green Finch, the beak and head formed like a Thruſh, and as fat as Hortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans in France and Italie, and our Wheat-ears in England. Another kind, not much bigger, but ſhaped like a Bittern, with a long bill, long legs and claws; a criſt of long Feathers on the Crown, and of a ſpeckled colour like an Hawke.</p>
            <p>When we came near to this ruined City, we ſaw abundance of broken Pillars of Marble and others, parts of Walls and Fundations along the ſhore, none ſtanding upright, nor whole, but lying on the ground, and many a good way in the Sea, ſcaled by the weather, and eaten by the Salt-winds, that come from thence. A little further is the mole of a Port yet remaining, with a large and thick wall on the ſhore; which doubtleſs was beautified with thoſe many Marble Pillars, that are now broken down all along under it: The mouth is now ſtopped up with ſand, and remaineth very ſhallow. I cannot with my Companion, ſay, That this was the Port of Troy, ſo famous in Antiquity; nor yet this City that Ilium, or Troy, whoſe Wars have
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95495:48"/>been ſo Celebrated by the Unimitable Homer and Virgil; nor the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities there remaining to be of any elder date then the Romans; although Bellonius is confident of it, and Petro della Valle, ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully pleaſed himſelf with the thoughts of it, that he fancied every great Tree a Hector, or Achilles, or an Aeneas, and all the Briers, and Buſhes, that pricked his ſhins, their Armies; and could not forbear crying out, <hi>Hic Dolopum manus, hic ſaevus tendebat Achilles; Claſſibus hic locus, hic acies certare ſolebant.</hi> But rather that modern Ilium Strabo calleth of his time; which from a Village of the Trojans was begun to be Built by Alexander the great, and was finiſhed by Lyſimachus, and called Alexandria; afterwards made a Roman Colonie, and enriched with many priviledges. This our worthy Country-man, Mr. <hi>Sands,</hi> hath remarked, and diſcourſed of at large, having, I believe, followed Strabo for his guide. But to proceed:</p>
            <p>A little above this Port are ſeveral Marble Tombs, ſome with the head of Apollo on them, and others with Bucklers; but I ſaw none here with Inſcriptions. Monſieur Spon obſerved, that they were of the ſhape of thoſe Roman Tombs at Arles in France; and therefore with all likely hood we judged them to be ſuch, and not of the Ancient Trojans, as Petro della Valle phanſieth. More South of the Port are two Pillars, lying upon the ground, of thirty Foot in length apiece; and another broken in three pieces, thirty five Foot, as Monſieur Spon Meaſured them; and the Diameter of this laſt, four Foot and nine Inches, of Granate Marble of Egypt. The Grand Signior hath had a great many Pillars carried from hence, to Build the New Moſque of the Sultane Mother. Going yet a little further along the ſhore we paſſed by ſome Ruins, that we ſuppoſed might have been an Aqueduct, to bring water to the Port: Some diſtance yet forward brought us to a Chanel, or Valley, which is long, ſtreight, and deep, and undoubtedly made by Art; perhaps to let in the Sea, for Boats to come to the City: But it is now altogether drie. Streight up, beyond this Vallie, a little on the Right hand we came to abundance of conſiderable Ruins, which evidently diſcover the former greatneſs of this place. There is a Theater there, the Foundations and Walls of vaſt Temples and Palaces, with Arches above, and Vaults under ground.</p>
            <p>There is alſo part of a little round Temple ſtanding, which hath a curious Marble Corniſh within, and hard by three Marble ſtones, made in the faſhion of Altars, or Pedeſtals, with Inſcriptions on them, differing only in the laſt Letters, as VIC. VII. and VIC. VIII.</p>

            <p>They were erected in honour of Caius, Antonius, Rufus, Son of Marcus, of the Tribe Voltinia, Prieſt to Julius and Auguſtus Caeſar, chief of the Colonie of Apros, of Claudius, of Philipi, of Julius; as likewiſe of the Parthian Colonie of Julius, the firſt two Cities of Thrace, and the laſt upon the Helleſpont, a Tribune of the Militia of the XXXII. Cohort of Voluntiers, Commander of the XIII. Legion, called Gemina, and Captain of the firſt Wing of Horſe of the Scibuli. Who theſe Scibull were I know not; whether a People, or a kind of Militia. Nor is the laſt line of every one of them eaſily underſtood. Monſieur Spon thinketh, that VIC. VII. VIC. VIII. VIC. IX. upon each of them, may fignifie Vicus Septimus, Vicus Octavus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Seventh, Eighth, or Ninth ſtreets, in which theſe Statues were ſet up in imitation of the ſtreets, and quarters of Rome, to which it was a Colony, planted by Auguſtus; who reſtored it again, as appeareth by many Medals; which ſhew it to have taken the name of Colonia Auguſti Troas from him.</p>
            <p>From the ſea ſhore there is a very eaſy aſcent unto the top of the hill; which is not high, but crowned with the Ruins of a moſt ſtately Building. What it hath been, whether Caſtle, Temple or Chriſtian Church, is hard to determin: Which becauſe none (that I have ſeen) hath yet done, I will endeavour to deſcribe, according to the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions I there took of it.</p>

            <p>The whole length is about Four Hundred and thirteen Foot, from North, to South; the breadth from Eaſt to Weſt, Two Hundred Twenty Four.

That on the Left-hand is divided into two oblongs: Whereof that which is outmoſt, Northward, is Twenty four paces
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95495:49"/>wide, or Seventy four Foot; and hath meerly the Foundations of the out walls remaining, and plain ground within. The next is Thirteen paces wide, or Thirty nine Foot, and is the greateſt part of it Vaulted and Arched underground. The other wing on the Left hand is of equal length, and Thirty three paces, or Ninety nine Foot in breadth. This hath nothing, but the Foundations of the Walls remaining, and plain ground within.</p>

            <p>Between theſe two there ſeemeth to have been a large Court; which brings you to three great Arches, in a great and high wall; before which lieth a vaſt heap of Marble Pillars, Pilaſters, Corniſhes, and other great Square-pieces in ſuch confuſed manner, that it is hard to judge in what form they were erected. But a Capital, and ſome Pillars ſhew them to have been of the Corinthian order, Channelled. I doubt not, but theſe made a moſt Magnificent Portico before thoſe three Arches; which where the Gates, to enter into this Building. For the Wall it ſelf is but of Free-ſtone, except the Frize on high, and ſome other Ornaments to the Arches which are of Marble; and above the Marble Freeze the wall beginning to bend forward, Arch-wiſe, as if it were to Vault a Portico, and the whole wall finiſheth at each end about the length of the heap of Marble. The dimenſions of this wall, and Arches are, as I took them by a French Foot (which differeth from ours but three parts of an hundred.) The middle Arch is Forty foot wide, and hath been walled up of the ſame ſtone and work; all to two little doors at each ſide. The two little Arches, on each hand of it, are Nineteen foot wide apiece, and filled up with ſtones, ſo that there is no entrance by them. The diſtance between the Arches is Ten foot; the diſtanoe from Arch to each Corner-end is Eleven and an half. The Front is thick Fourteen foot: So that I judge the Portico was a Hundred and Twenty foot
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95495:49"/>long, and about the breadth, that the great Arch is wide; which is Forty foot. Whoſe Vault was ſuſtained within by thoſe three Arches yet remaining, and without towards the Court by thoſe Corinthian Pillars of White Marble, now lying in a heap before the Arches; which without doubt muſt have had a wonderful effect upon the Eyes of the beholders.</p>
            <p>Where the wall of the Arches finiſh, begin the Foundations of another wall, on each hand, in a ſtreight line of the ſame breadth, and reacheth about Forty one foot to the other Foundations I firſt mentioned; ſo that the whole of the Front within the Court is Two Hundred and three foot. Entring at the middle Gate, or Arch, preſently you meet another Arch, which is low, and therefore (perhaps) was only an entrance to a Vault beneath. Going yet further you leave two ſquare Foundations on each hand, and have before you, in the wall oppoſite to the Front, a great Arched Niche, a Hundred foot from the great entrance; and another about the ſame bigneſs on each ſide of it, oppoſite to the two walls, at each ſide of the Portico; with half a dozen ſmall Niches between, on both ſides of the great one. From the Northern Niche beginneth the Northern Wall, full of little Arches, as you may ſee in that I have endeavour'd to delineate.</p>
            <p>The form of this Building would make me believe, that it hath bin a Chriſtian Church; did not the Ancient Beauty of the Corinthian work in Marble on the Front forbid me. For in the Ancient Churches of Greece are every where ſeen a Portico, or Pronaos, before the entrance into the body of the Church; where the Catechumeni, or thoſe which were not yet fully inſtructed in the Faith, or Penitents, who were not admitted into the more holy myſteries of Religion, were permitted to enter. Beſides, the three great Niches at the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, are not unlike to the end of a Greek Church: where that on the Right-hand reſembles the Protheſis: the middle, the place where the holy Table uſed to ſtand: and the third, that where the holy Garments uſed to be laid. But it is alſo true, that in Heathen Temples many times ſuch Niches are found, for Statues to be ſet in. However I believe it not the Caſtle of Priam, as the Country People now call it; nor of any earlier times then the Romans. Methinks, that it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing reſembles the form of the Temple of Diana at Epheſus; of which more hereafter.</p>
            <p>From this hill is an eaſie deſcent every way. To the Weſt, about two Miles is the Sea: Eaſtward is a large plain, ſtretched out between this hill and Mount Ida; which the River Simois watereth, and where in all probability ſtood the Ancient Ilum, unſeen by any of our Company, we not going ſo far that way; but proved by Mr. <hi>Sands</hi> at large. Northward is a deſcent into a ſmall plain; which then riſeth again to another hill, making the Ancient Promontorium Sigaeum, now Capo Janizzari, entring the Helleſpont about ſix, or eight Miles diſtant from the hill above mentioned.</p>
            <p>The day ending ſooner than our curioſity, we made haſt to return to our Boat. In the way we ſtayed to drink at a well, about a Hundred paces from the ſhore, not above a Bow ſhot North of the Ancient Port I before ſpoke of. The water of it is very good. But
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:95495:50"/>that they carried to the Veſſel from the hidden Chanel, about two Miles more Northward, prov'd not ſo.</p>
            <p>The twenty third of the ſame Month, after ſome days boarding againſt the wind, in ſight of the Fort of Tenedos, (which I obſerved to have little ſtrength either of Nature or Art, having only one Tower, furniſhed with about Fifteen pieces of Cannon) we came and dropped Anchor, near Capo Janizzari, before a Village called yet by the Greeks Troas. This Cape formerly had a Town called Sigaeum; whence that Cape, entring the mouth of the Helleſpont, was deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated. Here on the ſhore are two very good Fountains; from which our Veſſel furniſhed themſelves with water, and from the Town with Proviſions, which are very cheap; eſpecially Beans for Sea-men. Of Poultry, we had Fifteen fat Pullets for a Doller, which is leſs than a Groat apiece; and Eggs at leaſt a dozen for a Peny; and Melons, of many ſorts are ſo plentiful, that they ſell them for any thing they can get. The Inhabitants are all Greeks, who live by their labour, and the fruit of the ground: Which conſiſts in Corn, Wine, Saffron, Figs, Mellons, Almonds, and other Fruits. The Village may contain two or three hundred Families. The French piece of Money of five pence value, called in Turky a Timin, is very current Money every where, and there is worth Fourteen Aſpers. But the Aſper is but ſmall, and will not paſs at Conſtantinople.</p>
            <p>Saturday, the twenty ſeventh of Auguſt, we ſet Sail, and the ſame evening dropped Anchor on the South-ſide of Imbros, to gain wind. This Iſland is a little bigger then Tenedos, from which it lieth North. It hath four Villages; of which the Principal is Imbros, guarded by a Fort: It lieth high, and is Mountainous, covered with woods, which are for the moſt part a kind of wild Pear-tree, and are well ſtored with game; as Hares, Rabbets, and abundance of Wild Boars; of which the Flemiſh Gentleman killed with his Dog and Gun, in two hours time a Boar and Sow,<note place="margin">IMBROS.</note> with four of their Pigs. But the pleaſure coſt him dear; for he was left behind on the Iſland; the chief Commander hoiſting Sail ſooner than was expected; yet the Captain being ſo kind to leave his Skiff, and four Sea-men to wait for him, they found us at Anchor within the Caſtles, after two days time and much danger by weather, and the Current ſtill running very ſtrong out of the mouth of the Helleſpont. Monſieur Spon and I were almoſt in as bad a fear: For from the top of the Mountain, which we aſcended to view the Iſland, we ſoon ſaw our Ships under Sail; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the ſpeed we could make down, had almoſt loſt the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of returning to them. Nevertheleſs we obſerved that theſe Mountains had many pleaſant Vallies between them, well tilled, and divided into Corn-fields: And many pleaſant ſprings of excellent water, which falling, by many eaſie deſcents from the Rocks, make, as they paſs, ſeveral pleaſant little ponds to Bath in, under the ſhade of Fig-trees, Wild-Vines, Agnus Caſtus, and Oleander-trees.</p>
            <p>The twenty ninth, Sunday evening, we came with a ſide-wind to the mouth of the Helleſ-pont, and in the Morning entred it, ſaluting the New Caſtles,<note place="margin">HELLES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PONT.</note> placed on each ſide of the mouth, whoſe ſtrength conſiſts only in their great Guns, ſo mounted, that they can do execution
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95495:50"/>between wind and water. We gave them ſeven Guns, and they anſwered with one loaded, as the Turks ſtill do: We returned thanks with five: for at Sea they ſtill uſe an odd number in ſaluting; by which they ſignifie that they are Friends. I believe theſe new Caſtles were not Built in Mr. <hi>Sands</hi>'s time, becauſe he maketh no mention of them. That on Aſia ſide is ſeen from Troas, whence it lieth not above two Miles, juſt within the Promontory Sigaeum, or Capo Janizzari, upon a flat ground. The other juſt within the oppoſite Promontory of the Thracian Cherſoneſſus, on the ſide of a hill, with round Towers after the old faſhion, and ſeveral aſcents: The mouth lieth Weſt, a little inclining to the North; and hath a reach, that continueth ſo about ſeven, or eight Miles within; and then, ſome two or three Miles, before ye come at the Dardanelli, or old Caſtles (called ſo now in oppoſition to the new) it turneth Northward, towards the Propontis.</p>
            <p>As we entred in we paſſed very near a bank on the North ſhore, and dropped Anchor ſo near another about three or four Miles within, on the South-ſide of the Chanel, that we were forced to weigh again, to get more depth and better moorage; otherwiſe the Wind and Current would ſoon have driven us upon it. For it always ſetteth outward into the Archipelago with a ſtrong Current. This Chanel hath been famous in Hiſtory, and hath often changed name. For beſides the name of Helleſpont, or Sea of Hellas, Daughter of Athamas King of Thebes, drowned in paſſing it, when ſhe fled from the ſnares of her Step-mother, Ino, it was alſo called the ſtreights of Ceſtos and Abydos, two Cities Built on each ſide of its banks, oppoſite to each other, and famous for the Amours of Hero and Leander repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſome Medels of thoſe parts. And in theſe latter times it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called the Dardanelli; which I believe, properly belonged to that they now call Old Caſtles; and by the Italians Labocca di Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinopoli; by us the Chanel, or Streight, of Conſtantinople.</p>
            <p>The North-wind ſtill continuing, as it ſometimes doth in the Summer time two Months together, we could not get beyond this reach; and being tired with many days waiting for better weather, we reſolved to go aſhore, to a Village hard by on the Aſian Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, there to take Horſes, or ſome other means to carry us to the Old Caſtles; where we might get Boats for our paſſage to Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople. This Monſieur Spon took upno him, whilſt I ſtaid aboard to ſee all things in a readineſs to part. But he not returning the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I went my ſelf aſhore to ſee what was the matter: And was carried to a Greeks houſe, where he Lodged with the Biſhop of Micone, and Seriphus; who went aſhore with the ſame deſign with us. I found them at breakfaſt on Grapes, Figs, Honey-combs, Eggs, Cheeſe, and Water-Mellons; for the Biſhop, being a Caloyer (as they all are) never eateth any Fleſh.</p>
            <p>This Village is called Kainourio Chorio or New-town, conſiſting of about two hundred houſes, all Greeks. It ſtands very pleaſantly among Vineyards, and Almond-trees (Wine and Almonds being here extream cheap) and a kind of Juiuba, whoſe leaves ſhine like ſilver, and are long in ſhape, ſpringing out from long, and tender branches like a willow, and yielding fruit, like in ſhape and colour to other
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95495:51"/>Jujubs, but of a more mealy-taſt, perhaps, becauſe they were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe. The branches grow ordinarily upon a thick-poled trunk, like a willow: I have ſeen another kind of theſe, about Smyrna, with a broader leaf, of the like ſilver-colour, reſembling Portulaca Arbore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeens, where they grow wild in the hedges.</p>
            <p>But here we could get neither Horſes, nor Boat. Wherefore Monſieur-Spon had provided each of us a conceited Chariot, or, to tell the truth, a Cart. The Carriage was wreathed round with wicker, the better to hold the Fruits they bring out of the fields; drawn upon two Wheels, without Spokes, of one ſolid piece of wood; and inſtead of Flanders Mares, by a pair of Boufaleaus, which marched in great ſtate upon the Grand-pas. But they brought us to the Old Caſtles in as many hours as Miles, which I believe was ſeven or eight. The Conſul for the Engliſh, Dutch and Genoeſes, called Ezechiel Ruſer, met us by the way, and very civily offered to provide us accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, either at his own, or his Friends houſe; which we were glad to accept of; and being better mounted then we, did as he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and provided us Lodgings at his Friends, Abraham Corſer's houſe, Conſul for the Venetians; both Jews, but very civil perſons.</p>
            <p>This Caſtle is now called the Old Caſtle of Natolia, and the other the Old Caſtle of Romelia, as they now call the Continents of Greece and Aſia. But were formerly called the Dardanelli: That of Natolia may contain two or three Thouſand Souls. We expected, that they ſhould have been better fortified, being places ſo conſiderable for the guard of Conſtantinople. But they are nothing ſo in effect; having only two or three round Gothick Baſtions apiece: This of Natolia is ſituated upon a plain, low ground; the other upon the ſide of an hill, within Cannon ſhot of each other, no ways tenable by land. My Companion and I were of opinion, that theſe were not the Ancient Seſtos and Abydos, ſo famous for the Amours of Hero and Leander: Becauſe it is neither the narroweſt place of theſe Streights, nor yet could we find any Marke of Antiquity for it. But at a place much narrower, which we paſſed, about three or four Miles further North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, we found conſiderable Ruins on the ſhore of Natolia. This confirmed us in our opinion, and that the Dardanelli were Built after the Ruine of thoſe places. But having ſince conſulted Strabo, I am of opinion, that the City, Dardanus, was thereabouts; and that thence came the corrupted, modern, name of Dardanelli, applied to both Caſtles. For in Strabo's order Dardanus followeth Abydos; although his diſtance ſeemeth to differ from our remark; in which, without I had taken a more exact meaſure, I would give way to Strabo; who maketh it ſeventy Stadia, or about eight Miles.</p>
            <p>After this we hired a Boat, about the bigneſs of a ſmall Barge, for ten Dollers, to bring us to Conſtantinople, and parted from the Caſtles, accompanied, as the day before, with the Biſhop of Micone, and an ſtalian Gentleman of Millain; being ſometimes rowed, and ſometimes drawn by our Water-men againſt the ſtream: which ſtill ſetteth outward, though Petrodella Valle ſeemeth to make it run both ways. The Current is indeed ſtronger, when the North-wind blows, then when the South, or when it is a calm; but ſtill it
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95495:51"/>cometh out of the Black-Sea by the Boſphorus, into the Mare Marmora, and thence into the Archipelago, as they now call the Euxin, Propontis, and Aegean Seas. After awhile we came to that place, which we ſuppoſe to be the true, Ancient Abydos, and there croſſed the ſtreight, about two Miles over, to the European ſhore; whence the Mariners, rowing all Night, brought us by break of day to Gallipoli.</p>
            <p>Gallipoli is a large City, Situated at the mouth of the Propontis,<note place="margin">GALLIPOLI.</note> in the Thracian Cherſoneſſus, called of old by Strabo, Callipolis, not juſt oppoſite to Lampſacus, (as ſome ſay) but ſome Miles more North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. It is almoſt an Iſland, having to the North and South two Bays for Gallies and Boats; and I judge that Ships may ride in the Southern moſt ſafe; though near the Current. On the ſhore are ſome old dry Stations for Gallies: The Town looketh better from without, then within; as do moſt of the Towns in Turky. For the Moſques (or Churches) and Bazeſtans, (or places of Traffick) have their high Cupuloes covered with Lead: which with the Minaretts (or high ſlender Steeples, from whence they ſound out their ſhrill Voices inſtead of Bells, at their times of Prayer) and the goodly tall Cypreſs mixt among the houſes, make a very pleaſant proſpect. But the houſes are inconſiderable, and low, Built generally of Wood and Earth: the ſtreets narrow, and ſometimes covered with Wood to keep off the Sun. The Town is not walled, no more then moſt of the Cities, or Towns in Turky; except ſome Frontier Towns: But they ſay it is about ſix Miles about. At our arrival we were ſaluted with the news, that the Plague was in the Town, and much more at Conſtantinople; which is no great Noveltie in Turkey, being ſeldom, or never free. So we thought we had as good begin here to accuſtome our ſelves to its company: But with all care; putting our confidence in the great preſerver of Mankind.</p>
            <p>This place did not ſeem at all populous, conſidering the bigneſs; whether becauſe of the Plague, or not, I am not certain; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they reckon the number of the Inhabitants, to be Twelve Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Turks, Four or Five Thouſand Greeks, and as many Jews. The Bezeſtan is the only thing worth ſeeing here; being Built Square, with ſix Cupoloes covered with Lead. We lodged in an open place, by the Southern harbour; being unwilling to venture our ſelves, where we knew no body, eſpecially when the place was ſo infected. But had the Italian Conſul (who was a Frier of the order of Saint Francis) been in Town, at his little Convent, of him we might have hoped for directions to better accommodation. This place hath the reputation of the beſt Water-Melons in thoſe parts; and we had as many as we would for nothing; there lying great heaps of them neglected, in the place where we Lodged. There remain ſmall marks of its Antiquity, and not much of its fame in Ancient Authors. On ſhore, by the Southern Port, lieth a Frize of Marble, very well wrought; and we found in the Town a ſmall Inſcription, where the name of one Theodotus and Bitana, Daughter of Anticles is mentioned.</p>

            <p>We hoped to find ſomewhat more conſiderable at Lampſaco;<note place="margin">LAMSPACO.</note> which is on the oppoſite ſide of the ſtreight, on the Aſian ſhore, ſomething more to the Southward: And therefore, the wind being contrary for our proceeding forward, we took a bigger Boat and croſſed over, notwithſtanding a ſtrong wind, that from the Propontis brought ſuch foaming billows, as often was like to oreturn our little Veſſel.</p>
            <p>Lampſacus, now called Lampſaco, hath loſt the advantage it had in Strabo's time of Callipoli; being now but a ſmall Town inhabited by Turks, and ſome Greeks. Strabo counted the ſtreight about five Miles over; and I believe it is not much more or leſs. Lampaſcus was one of the Towns Xerxes gave to Themiſtocles: Magnaſia was for his Bread, Myuns for his Meat, and this for his Wine. And it hath yet indeed abundance of fine Vineyards all about it, eſpecially on the South parts, well hedged with Pomegranate Trees. In this place the God Priapus, was worſhipped before any of the reſt, as Pauſanias affirmeth: And was more Anciently called Petyuſa. It had a good harbour, and was counted Twenty one Miles [or 170 <hi>Stadia</hi>] from Abydos: It now conſiſts of about Two Hundred houſes, and hath a fine Moſque; whoſe Portick is ſupported by Red Marble Pillars. It was formerly (they ſay) a Chriſtian Church as they well prove by the Croſſes that yet remain, carved on the Capitals of the Pillars. Entring into the Coffee-houſe, we met with one that could ſpeak a little Italian, and was ſo kind, as for our Money to ſhew us the Town; and indeed ſhewed us many Inſcriptions. The beſt were in the Garden of a Turk, called Achmet, Aga, Tchelebi.</p>
            <p>The firſt is a Dedication of a Statue to Julia Auguſta, complemented with the Titles of Veſta and new Ceres, by the Corporation; but the Coſt of both the Baſis and ſetting up was done at the proper Charge of Dioniſius, Son of Apollonotimus, overſeer of the decent diſtribution of the Coronets Prieſt of the Emperours and Coronet-bearer of all their Family, the ſecond time Treaſurer of the Senate.</p>

            <p>Another he ſhewed us, where he ſaid were formerly many Pillars, and other Marbles dug up; and ſome other Ruins, which we judged to have been the Ancient Walls of the Town. Another we Copied at a Chriſtians houſe; who told us, there had been ſome Veſſels of Marble, with Inſcriptions on them, found thereabouts in the ground, and are now in the hands of a Turk, though formerly belonging to a Prieſt, which we could not ſee, he not being then at home. He alſo conducted us about a Mile out of Town, through the Vineyards, to the Foundation of an Ancient Temple; where he told us was an Inſcription, but we found it not. There lie about it a dozen of Marble Pillars, at the Front, heaped upon one another: of which they confidently tell, that part of theſe were carried by the Turks to the Town, to Build a Moſque with; but that they were brought back again in the Night by no body knows what means, and that twice after one another.</p>
            <p>The Turks here are not ſo ſcrupulous, as in many other places; where they dare not plant Vineyards; Wine being forbidden them by their Law. Here they take the liberty of making them boiled Wines for Sorbet; and make Aqua Vitae, under the pretence of having Grapes to eat: Of which moſt of them drink more freely than we do.</p>
            <p>We returned in the evening to Gallipoli, with the ſame wind as in the Morning, and little leſs danger. The next evening we parted from Gallipoli in the calm, and in the Morning found our ſelves at Peraſte, Thirty Miles forwarder on the Thracian coaſt.<note place="margin">PERASTE.</note> It is a Town of about two hundred houſes. Here the Aga, or Governour, ſent very civilly for us his Son; (having ſeen the Abbot Charpentier before at the Old Caſtles: Who went the ſame way with us;) and entertained us with Coffee, and other Fruits. Here the number of the Turks and Chriſtians are about equal. At a Church we ſaw the head of a Bacchus defaced, with ſome other Fragments of Antiquity, here and there upon the ground: But I cannot well gueſs at the Ancient name of the place; we bought Wine here, for our Voyage, at four Aſpers the Oka, (a weight uſed in Turkey of about Forty two Ounces, as I remember) which is not above Three-half-pence the quart.</p>
            <pb n="78" facs="tcp:95495:53"/>
            <p>Half a dozen Miles further we ſtopped again, at a Village called Heracliſſa,<note place="margin">HERACLIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SA.</note> a good large Town on a hill.</p>
            <p>About ſix or ſeven Miles further, at an other Town, called by the Greeks Myriophyton, and by the Turks Murfton, of about two hundred houſes, here walking in the ſtreets, we were daſhed out of Countenance by the Children; who flocked after Monſieur Spon, making a noiſe we underſtood not: which I believe was, by reaſon Monſieur Spon had put on a pair of Turkiſh Slippers to his French Sute; which I confeſs made but a ridiculous ſhow. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore returned to our Boats; and there were met by the Sangiac, that governed the place; who ſeeing us to be Strangers, accoſted us very civilly with the little Lingua Franca that he had. He told us, that he had been taken a Slave about three years before, and carried to Malta, by one Captain Daniel of Marſeilles, a Pyrate; of whoſe civility to him he gave great Commendations; and that it was but a little while ſince he got his liberty, which coſt him ſix hundred Dollers. He was very civil, asked us whether we wanted any Proviſions, and after we had taken our leave of him, ſent us a Basket of admirable white Grapes, in bunches of a great length, and the Fruit as big as Pigeons Eggs.</p>
            <p>Hence, four or five Miles further we came to a large Town, called Chora,<note place="margin">CHORA.</note> ſituated very pleaſantly on a little hill, whoſe aſcent is ſteep on every ſide; which ſeparates it, as by a large Trench, from the High-hills that encompaſs it on all parts, except towards the Sea. From thence parting in the evening, we made about twenty Miles,<note place="margin">RODESTE.</note> and found our ſelves in the morning over againſt Rodeſte. A Town at leaſt as big as Gallipoli, and more populous. It is ſituated upon the brow of an hill, at the bottom of a Bay, and maketh a goodly ſhew towards the Sea. We could number ten or twelve Moſques by the Minaretts. The Greeks have alſo they ſay many Churches there.</p>
            <p>From Rodeſte the ſhore of the Propontis (or mare Marmora) rangeth it ſelf Eaſtwards. At the oppoſite Promontorie of this Bay we made a ſtop; becauſe we ſaw the weather begin to gather: which made us look for a wind, but from what quarter we knew not; for it was till now calm. This gave me opportunity to ſearch, what Plants this ſhore produced. Beſides ſeveral that I had mentioned before in other places, I found a ſort of Shrub Spurge, which by the Herbaliſts is named Eſula Rara, Atractylis Purpurea; and one or two more, I have not yet names for.</p>
            <p>We had not ſtaid here long, but the wind we expected proved a briſque South-wind; which three or four hours before Night brought us thirty Miles over a Gulph to Heraclea. This Town hath a good harbour; whoſe mouth lieth Eaſt of it,<note place="margin">HERACLEA.</note> turning about ſo, that it maketh a Peninſula. It bends round in the form of an Amphitheater, and may have about four or five Miles in Circumference. The Town lieth in the Streight, having the Sea on the one ſide, and the Port on the other; we made haſt aſhore, to employ what time we had in viewing it; ſoon diſcovering it to be a place of great Antiquity by the Foundations of the old walls, eſpecially on the Weſt-ſide, and towards the Haven; where ſtrewed up and down, we ſaw abundance of Fragments of Marble
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95495:53"/>Statues, Corniſhes, Bulls-heads, Wreaths of Plenty, and broken Pillars; and of ſuch are compiled the preſent Buildings of the Town. Among thoſe we ſaw ſome Inſcriptions; which we went to Copy, but unfortunately my Comerades, and I both had loſt our Pens; a damage in Turky not eaſily repaired: For they write with Pens made of Reeds which we could hardly have uſed. But by better fortune we caſt our Eyes upon a Gooſe wing, lying in the ſtreets, which furniſhed us again with Pens; and therewith we Copyed ſeveral good Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, eſpecially one, where we found the name Perinthus, which this City bare in the time of the firſt Roman Emperours; it being more Anciently called Heraclea; which it regain'd in the time of the latter Emperours, as Zozimus reporteth, and yet retains the ſame.</p>

            <p>This Inſcription is on the Pedeſtal of a Statue erected to the honour of the Emperour Severus, whom they had reaſon to honour as their Benefactour, becauſe he Sublected Byzantium to them; at which he was offended, becauſe that Town had eſpouſed the party of Peſcennius Niger againſt him. Sir <hi>John Finch,</hi> the Kings Embaſſadour at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople as we were one day Diſcourſing concerning the Situation of this place, gave us an account of an Inſcription, that he found at a Town called Chourly, in the way to Adrianople, erected in honour of the Emperour Herennius Etruſcus, by the Perinthians; which being too big to be removed, he was of opinion, that that might be the Ancient Perinthus. But we concluded, that it was rather a Town under the jurisdiction of the Perinthians, as Byzantium was, a great deal further off. For this is not many Miles diſtant from Heraclea but could not be the Perinthus, becauſe the Ancient Geographers make it a Port as Town Traclea is, but Chourly an In-land Town. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reverſe of their Coyn was uſually a Gally, of which I have a curious Medalion, that my Friend Monſieur Spon helped me to at my return.

            <p>We found here another Inſcription of the Emperour, Hadrian, in the Cathedral Church; beſides one more in the Town, being only a Sepulchral ſtone of a Roman. As poor a place as it now is, it is an Archbiſhops ſeat; whoſe Church is one of the beſt now ſtanding in Turkey: And in times of the Chriſtian Emperours this Metropolitane was one of the three, that with the Patriarch had the priviledge of Crowning the Emperour at his Inauguration.</p>
            <p>In the Cathedral Church in a little Chappel, at the Right-hand is the Tomb of one of our Country-men, that died here, whilſt he was Embaſſadour from his Majeſty of Great Britain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Guitts,</hi> written in Greek Characters thus:

            <p>We parted about Midnight in a calm, and about Sun-riſing paſſed Selimbria, which is an Ancient Town, on our Left-hand.

            <p>All about theſe parts are the Serraglioes, or Countrey-houſes of the great Men among the Turks, (juſt as it is Ten, or Twenty Miles about London) with their Gardens, Vineyards, and Groves of Cypreſs-trees. The evening we came to St. Stephano's about nine, or ten Miles from Conſtantinople; a large Town, and moſt of the Inhabitants Chriſtians. Here we lay all Night in our Boat; and parting early in the Morning we doubled the Cape of the Boſphorus Thracius; which is about three Miles from the Southern Walls of Conſtantinople; where we arrived Monday the Thirteenth of September.</p>

            <p>Our Modern Geographers,<note place="margin">LATITUDE.</note> in their Maps, place this City in Forty-three Degrees of Latitude: But Dr. <hi>Covel,</hi> Chaplain to Sir <hi>John Finch,</hi> the Engliſh Ambaſſador, when I was there, aſſured us, That by many Obſervations made with the Aſtrolabe at the Aequinoctials, he found it to have only Forty Degrees, and Fifty ſix Minutes; which agreed alſo with the Obſervations of a late <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> a good Mathematician, who lived there, and alſo, that <hi>Adrianople</hi> hath Forty Degrees, and Eighteen Minutes.</p>

            <p>They are built of rough Stone, and here and there patched up with Brick, being ſingle towards the Sea, but ſome part towards the Land double.</p>
            <p>There are about Five and Twenty Gates, Seven towards the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pontis,<note place="margin">GATES.</note> Seven towards the Land, and Eleven towards the Haven.</p>

The Private Houſes are but mean and beggarly; it is only the Grand Signior's Palace, the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:95495:56"/>Moſques, Bagnos, Bazzars, and Kans, that make ſo ſplendid a ſhew at a Diſtance; of ſome of which, I will now ſpeak more particularly.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as we could Equippe our ſelves after the Turkiſh Mode, we were in pain to ſee the Grand Signior's Palace,<note place="margin">SERAGLIO.</note> whereof we had ſo ſplendid a Proſpect from <hi>Gallata,</hi> and of which we had heard ſo great Things by Fame. For from thence its Roofs raiſed high more by the Advantage of the Ground, than its Numbers of Stories, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of a great Number of Cuppaloes, covered with Lead, encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with large Gardens, ſhaded with Cypreſs-Trees, wonderfully raiſed our Expectation, at that Diſtance. The <hi>Turks</hi> call it <hi>Padiſha-Seraï,</hi> ſignifying the Kings or Emperours Palace, <hi>Seraï</hi> ſignifying any great Building; and from this word, our Weſtern Chriſtians form <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio,</hi> which they apropriate to this Palace. As the whole City, ſo is That in proportion a kind of a Triangle, waſhed on two ſides by the Sea, and ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rated from the reſt of the City by a high Wall, South-Weſt and South, which may be about Three Miles in Compaſs. We were conducted by a Street along the Weſtern-Wall, till we came to the Southern-Gate; which hath nothing about it ſo ſtately, that all Ambaſſadours ſhould be denominated from thence Ambaſſadour at our Lofty Port, as it is ſtill expreſſed in all Capitulations with the Grand Signior. It is propped up on the Out-ſide with Two courſe Marble Pillars, ſet up with little Art or Ornament, only ſome old Armour is hung up on the In-ſide. It leadeth into a long, but narrow Court, lying in no Decent Order: At the Right-hand whereof, are ſome Buildings, ſerving for ſuch as are Sick, in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> to lodge till they are cured. On the Left-hand is a Building, where the meaneſt Servants are lodged. Beyond that is another Round Building, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſome to have been part of Hagia-Sophia; but I doubt, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is too great, to have ſerved as a Sacriſty to it, as ſome think. There is now ſome Arms laid up in it, as we obſerved, looking into it from a great Wood-ſtack piled up between it and the Hagiam-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lams, or Servants Lodgings. Beyond this is another great Gate, which brings into another large Quadrangle, divided into many Irregular Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrs, planted with ſeveral ſorts of Trees, according as the Wayes to the ſeveral Offices direct, having a large Fountain placed in the Middle. This Court is encompaſſed on this ſide of the Gate, and the Right-hand, with a fair Portico, ſuſtained by the tall Granate Marble Pillars; whoſe Capitals, and Baſes, are bound with Braſs, paved with Marble, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Lead, in many ſmall Cuppaloes. At the Left-hand, ſome Diſtance from the Gate, is their Court of Judicature they call the <hi>Divan;</hi> where all Civil and Criminal Cauſes are tryed by the Vizier, or his Deputy, the Chaimacham, aſſiſted by other Lawyers. We were not permitted to go in, but ſaw them only at a Diſtance; for none are allowed Entrance, but ſuch as have Buſineſs. It joyns to other Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, continued up to the Side, oppoſite to the Gate: whence the Grand Signior can come, when he pleaſeth, to a private Window, looking into the Divan, to hear the Determinations of Cauſes, unſeen to any preſent; and, if he obſerves any Injuſtice done by his Officers, calls them to an Account for it; which hath many times coſt them their Places, and ſometimes their Lives, in other Emperours Reigns: but This hath
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:95495:56"/>ſeldom Reſided here long; otherwiſe from the Sentence of the Vizier, or Chaimacham, there is no Appeal, or other Remedy. The Buildings on the other ſide, oppoſite to the Gate, are low built; they ſeemed, at that diſtance, only to conſiſt of Wood and Mortar, expreſſing little of Beauty or Art; the only Ornament is the Roof, built of many ſmall Cuppaloes near together, covered with Lead. On the Right Hand of this Quadrangle, is a Gate that leadeth to a whole Street of Kitchins and Stables, whoſe Roofs are all covered with Lead, and beautifyed with Cuppaloes. The Kitchins ſeem too ſtately for the Turkiſh Cooke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; whoſe chief Diſh is only Rice, half boyled with a Hen, which they call Pillau. I ſaw not many fine Horſes in the Streets, becauſe the Grand Signior was at <hi>Adrianople.</hi> The inmoſt Court of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio, beyond the Third Gate, and the Womens Appartment, is kept Secret, and to Chriſtians inacceſſible, except upon extraordinary Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. Beyond them, to the point of the Promontory, are the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, which towards the Weſt alſo, reach up to the great Gate. They ſpeak of Fountains, and great Curioſities in them; but unſeen to us. We were carried upon the Top of the Wood-pile, at the Weſt End of that round Building, ſuppoſed to belong to Hagia-Sophia; whence we could look over the Wall, into the Gardens: The greateſt Ornaments we could diſcover, were the tall Cypreſs-Trees; but ſet in no good Order: And as to Knots, Flowers, and other Delights of that Nature, I could diſcover none. They ſpeak of an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Obelisk here; which we ſhould have been glad to have ſeen, but more of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, reported to be in the Seraglio; and in that more particularly of <hi>T. Livius,</hi> that is ſaid to be there entire: But we were told, That it could never be found, although vaſt Sums of Money have been offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Buſtangi Baſha for it.</p>
            <p>When we had ſeen as much as we were permitted, of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> we returned out by the ſame way we came; for although there be ſome other Gates, yet they are not for any ordinarily to paſs out and in at, but kept ſtill faſt.</p>
            <p>Our Curioſity led us, in the next place, to ſee the great Moſques;<note place="margin">MOSQUES.</note> which are indeed very Magnificent, and Splendid. The firſt, near the Seraglio, is Hagia-Sophia, or Sancta-Sophia; the <hi>Turks</hi> having continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Name, although they have robbed <hi>God</hi> of the Honour once paid Him by the Chriſtian Worſhip in that Place: For it was once a moſt Magnificent Church, built by the Emperour <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> and dedicated to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Wiſdom of <hi>God,</hi> by the Title of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. On the Weſtern End is a large Portico, the Breadth of the whole Fabrick, which you enter into by the Three great Doors; and is ceil'd with Moſaick Work, containing ſeveral Hiſtorical Figures out of the Holy Scripture, but ſomewhat defaced by the <hi>Turks.</hi> This leads into the Church, by Five large Braſs Folding-Doors, which is a moſt Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Fabrick, ceil'd again with Moſaick Work, paved with ſeveral ſorts of Marble, Porphyry, Serpentine, Jaſper, and Figures of Inchaſed Work. It is a very great Length, and is crowned towards the Eaſt End, with a vaſt Cuppalo, ſuſtained by four maſſy Pillars, encruſted as are all the Walls, with a whitiſh Marble. The great Cuppalo is encompaſſed by ſmall ones ſomewhat lower. St. <hi>Peters</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> may excel this Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palo
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:95495:57"/>in height, but not in Breadth nor Beauty. Four very tall and ſlender Steeples, they call Minorets, are placed by the <hi>Turks</hi> about it; one at each end of the Portico, and the reſt on each ſide the Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palo, ranging ſquare to each other. But for theſe Spires they have added, they have taken very much more from it; if it reached former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as is thought, to the Seraglio. It is vaulted underneath, which now ſerveth for a Ciſtern to receive the Waters from the Aqueducts, whence it is conveyed about the City by Pipes. This is neither kept ſo well in repair, nor adorned as the other Moſques built by the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans: Therefore I will defer to deſcribe its Furniture as a Moſque, till I come to another more Magnificently adorned.</p>
            <p>About Hagia-Sophia,<note place="margin">SEPUE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHERS.</note> ſome diſtance from the Outward Gate of the Seraglio, are many of the Sepulchers of the Grand Signiors. They are little ſquare Buildings, of white Marble, and covered with Cuppa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes. Within are placed their Tombs, encompaſſed with a low Rail, or Grate. The Emperour lies in the middle, in a large Cheſt of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, made bigger towards the Head than Feet, covered with a Pall of Silk, and ſometimes Embroidered; Wax-Candles ſtand one at the Head, and another at the Feet, of the bigneſs of a Mans Leg, and about a Yard long: Their Wives and Children lie about them in Cheſts of the ſame Shape, but leſs according to their Age and Bigneſs. The Males are diſtinguiſhed from the Females by a Turbant, ſet up at the Head of each Tomb; the Females have only a Pall on theirs. Thoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that have been Strangled by the ſucceeding Emperour, are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the reſt, by a Handkerchief tied about the Staff, holding up the Turbant. Theſe Sepulchers are frequented by poor Men, who have an Alms allowed them for ſaying Prayers for the Souls of the Deceaſed, which they number by long ſtrings of Wooden Beads, as big as Musket-Bullets; being placed there, and wound up on great Rolls for that purpoſe: For not only the <hi>Latines,</hi> but the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> uſe Beads in their Prayers; but the Two laſt tell them over the faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt: For the <hi>Latines</hi> conſiſt of a Circle of different Prayers; but the <hi>Greeks</hi> uſe only <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Lord have Mercy upon me;</hi> and the <hi>Turks</hi> either a word in their own Language to the ſame Effect, or another ſignifying <hi>God be praiſed.</hi> We went into Three or Four of theſe; but the moſt melancholy Sight, was that of Sultan <hi>Hackmet,</hi> who (they told us) had an Hundred and Twenty Children all deſtroyed by the ſucceeding Emperour, in one day, and lie there Buried about him.</p>
            <p>From the Southern-Gate of the Seraglio, and Sancta-Sophia, goeth the faireſt and largeſt Street of the whole City, quite through it Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, paſſing by the Northern-End of the Hippodrome, and ſo to <hi>Adrianople</hi>-Gate. This Street is adorned with ſeveral of the Monuments of the Viziers and Baſha's, who have highly merited of the Emperour either in the Wars or Government. Among which, we obſerved one with the Cuppalo, covered only with a Grate of Wyer; of which we had this Account:<note place="margin">CUPRIOULI.</note> That it was of <hi>Mahomet Cupriuli,</hi> Father to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Vizier, who ſettled the Government, during the Minority of the preſent Emperour, very near Deſtruction, through the Diſcontents and Factions of the Principal Hagaes, and the Mutinies of the Janizaries. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom, after his Deceaſe, being buried here, and having this
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:95495:57"/>ſtately Monument of white Marble, covered with Lead, Erected over his Body; the Grand Signior, and Grand Vizer, had this Dream both in the ſame night; to wit, That <hi>Cupriuli</hi> came to them, and earneſtly beg'd of them a little Water to refreſh him, being in a burning heat: Of this the Grand Signior and Vizier told each other, in the Morning, and thereupon thought fit to conſult the Mufti, what to do concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; who according to their groſs Superſtition, adviſed that he ſhould have the Roof of his Sepulcher uncovered, that the Rain might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend on his Body, thereby to quench the Flames tormenting his Soul. And this Remedy the People who ſmarted under his Oppreſſion, think he had great need of, ſuppoſing him to be tormented in the other World, for his Tyrannies and Cruelties committed by him in This.</p>

            <p>From Hagia-Sophia, we were Conducted by this great Street,<note place="margin">THE HIPPO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DROME</note> to the place Achmet-dam; which was antiently an Hippodrome, or a place for Horſe-racing. It is about Five hundred and fifty ordinary Paces long, and about an Hundred and twenty broad, and was adorned an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently with ſeveral excellent Ornaments; of which only Three Pillars remain for me to give you an Account of.</p>
            <p>The firſt is a Pillar of <hi>Egyptian</hi> Granite Marble,<note place="margin">HIEROGLY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHICAL PIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAR.</note> conſiſting of one Stone about Fifty Foot long, and erected on a Pedeſtall of Eight or Ten Foot above ground; but how much under, I know not. The Pillar is four ſquare, ending on the Top in a Cone, and is engraven on the four ſides with many Todd Figures; and therefore hath deſervedly obtained the name of the Hieroglyphical Pillar: For thoſe Figures are really the Hieroglyphicks of the Antient <hi>Egyptians;</hi> to the Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which, our Modern Learning will not reach. It is probable, this Pillar was brought hither by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great; who was very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:95495:58"/>in Adorning this City, that it might in all things equal Old <hi>Rome.</hi> But after, by Time, Earthquakes, or other bad Fortune, it was tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled down; It was again ſet up in Thirty-two dayes, by the Emperour <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> as the Two Inſcriptions on the Eaſt and Weſt-ſides of the Pedeſtal, the one in Latine, and the other in Greek, informed us.</p>

            <p>On the North of the Pedeſtal, is a Baſſo relievo, expreſſing the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how this Pillar was ſet up; and another below that, repreſenting the Hippodrome, as it was before the ſetting up, with the manner of their Horſe-racing. It appears with four principal Pillars, with a vacant place in the middle where this is now ſet up, which made the Feet all equally diſtant one from each other. The ordinary Stadiums of the Antients had but Three Pillars, being but One hundred and twenty five paces long; which is a great deal ſhorter than this From the Firſt Pillar they ſtarted their Horſes, having the word
ΑΡΙΣΤΕΥΕ,
or Courage, written on the Pillar, given them. At the Middle they were called upon to make haſte, by the word
ΣΠΕΥΔΕ,
which was written alſo on the Pillar. At Laſt they were to return riding about the Pillar on the further end; therefore, it had the word
ΚΑΜΨΟΝ
engraven on it. By this Baſſo-relievo, is expreſſed the Running of the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and the Emperour ſtanding in the middle, crowning the Victor: But what that held up by Four Pillars, and the other ſingle round Pillar were for, we could not conjecture; unleſs only for Ornament. Higher upon the middle part of the Baſis, are other Baſſo-relievoes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven on the Four ſides: On one is the Emperour <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Wreath in his Hand, with a great Croud of Souldiers about him. On another, is repreſented a great Company, rejoycing with Muſick of ſeveral ſorts. On another, is repreſented the Emperour, ſeated on a Throne with his Two Sons, <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Arcadius,</hi> attended on by the reſt of his Nobility: But our time would not permit us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne any more than what I have given you.</p>
            <p>At the Southern End is another ſquare Pillar of white Marble;<note place="margin">THE OTHER PILLAR.</note> but compoſed of many pieces, raiſed on a Pedeſtal of the ſame: The Top is broken off, and the reſt looks ready to fall down. There is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription on the Baſis, which we could not copy, by reaſon of ſome Houſes built about it, ſaid then to be infected with the Plague: But Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> had the Opportunity to do it, and hath Printed it in his Book after this manner; whence, by his Permiſſion, I will take it.</p>

            <p>To this middle Cuppalo, are joyned Four half Cuppaloes, of the ſame Diameter with the middle one; but much lower: to which, a ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Cuppalo being fitted to each Corner, the whole ſquare Area is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in a moſt ſplendid manner with Lead, adorned on the Top with gilded Globes, and Spires, ſuſtaining ſo many Creſcents, the Badge or Enſign of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire. It is flagged alſo within with white Marble, and paved in like manner.</p>
            <p>To all this, are erected Six exceeding hig, and ſlender Steeples or Spires, which look like our Pillar at <hi>London,</hi> built in memory of the Fire. They are chanelled alſo, but end in a gilded Spire, ſuſtaining a Creſcent. They are placed Two at the Weſtern-Corners of the Court, Two at the Front of the Moſque, and Two behind. About the middle of each of them, there are Three Balconies, or Galleries, one above the other; to which their Prieſts aſcend by a winding pair of Stairs, to ſound forth their ſhrill Voices, at ſeveral Times of the Night, and Day, to call the People to their Devotions. Theſe alſo, at their Feaſts, New Moons, and ſolemn Occaſions, they hang round with Lamps; which being lighted at Night, make a very ſplendid. Show at a diſtance; as I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten obſerved from <hi>Gallata:</hi> they being lighted almoſt every Night whilſt I was there, by reaſon of the Plague then raging in a more than ordinary manner.</p>
            <p>This is the only Royal Moſque I obſerved to have Six Spires; the reſt have Four a piece, or at leaſt Two; but the ordinary Moſques have uſually but One. This Moſque is adorned within after this manner: The Floor is covered with fine Indian Mats, and Turkey-work Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets; becauſe they ſlip off their Papuchas, or Shoes, when they go in to do their Devotions. The Roof, Seven or Eight Foot from the Ground, is hung with many great Circles of Lamps, one within ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, intermixed with Luſtres, or Balls of Glaſs; and ſeveral other pretty Curioſities, which, when lighted at their Evening Devotions, muſt needs make a ſplendid Show. There is a Chair, with a Desk on the Left Hand, where the <hi>Mufti</hi> reads, and expounds the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> and on the other Side, there goes up a little narrow pair of Stairs, on the Top of which they read their Prayers. Between theſe, and on the Eaſt, or South-Eaſt-End, is a place made in the Wall, formed like a Niche, to ſet a large Statue in, with the Bottom even with the Ground. On each Hand of this Niche ſtands a very great Wax-Candle, in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable Braſs Candle-ſtick. Within the Niche, in <hi>Arabick</hi> Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, is written the Form of the Mahometan Profeſſion of Faith. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this they alwayes turn their Faces, when they ſay their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; which, I believe, is towards <hi>Mecha,</hi> their Prophets Tomb; becauſe,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:95495:61"/>when they turn a Church into a Moſque, which ſtands due Eaſt and Weſt, they alwaies make ſuch a Niche on purpoſe, on the Southern-Wall, as I obſerved in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>John</hi>'s Church at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and the Temple of <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi> at <hi>Athens.</hi> This is called the New Moſque, although ſeveral very ſtately ones have been built ſince; eſpecially one lately by the Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Mother to the preſent Emperour, ſituate upon the Harbour, near the Garden-Gate; which, although it be not incloſed within an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court like <hi>Achmet</hi>'s, it is nevertheleſs very Magnificent, and hath its peculiar Beauties and Ornaments: For although its Architecture be not according to our Rules, it wants not either Beauty or Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity. Its Figure, Roof of Cuppaloes, Court and Fountain, is like the former; as alſo, the tall and gilded Spires, although not ſo many in number. The ſquare Court before it hath a Fountain, and is alſo ſurrounded with a Portico, ſuſtained by Beautiful Pillars of divers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Marble, ſome white, ſome ſpeckled; but the Two at the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Moſque, are of Jaſper, admirably well poliſhed, and proportioned. But this was not done by the Turkiſh Art; but of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Times being brought from the Ruins of <hi>Troy,</hi> or <hi>Alexandria.</hi> The Walls and Pillars within, are faced with blue and white Purat Tiles, as the <hi>French</hi> King's Houſe of Pleaſure at <hi>Verſailles,</hi> called the <hi>Trianons,</hi> is without. The Frize that rangeth about the Cuppalo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, is plain; but well proportioned, and of white Marble. The Glaſſes of their Lamps, making a ſecond Roof within, by the many Circles one within another, are adorned with Flowers; which kind of Paint is not forbidden by their Law, as that of Animals is. They are intermixed alſo with Glaſs Balls, curious pieces of wrought Ivory, gilded Veſſels, models of other Moſques, and many other pretty De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; which muſt needs make a moſt ſplendid Show, when the Lamps are lighted at their Night-ſervice: But this is too dangerous an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, for a Chriſtian Curioſity to venture to ſee. Although at other times, by-vertue of a ſmall Reward to the Keeper, you may ſee any Moſque there. On each hand from the Entrance, is a Gallery ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Marble Pillars, the Floor being ſtrewed with Carpets and Mats; and having a Pulpit or Desk-ſtairs, to read Prayers, and a Niche, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which they pray, as <hi>Achmet</hi>'s, and as indeed all other Moſques have; for the Ornaments are much the ſame in all, only the Difference is in the Coſt, Beauty, and Magnificence: So that, when one hath ſeen the Two or Three beſt, one hath ſeen more than all contained in the reſt. Therefore, this ſhall ſuffice for the Deſcription of the Moſques.</p>
            <p>There are Six more of theſe Royal Moſques, whoſe Names are <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leymania,</hi> ſituate near the Old Seraglio South, and the great Street North, and the Hippodrome Eaſtwards: Of this I took no particular Notice; but Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> ſaith, It is paved with large Tables of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry, and its Cuppalo ſuſtained by Pillars of the ſame. Beyond which Weſt-wards, ſtands <hi>Bajazets.</hi> On another high Hill ſtandeth <hi>Shahza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,</hi> or <hi>Shaſhdads,</hi> which is the Fifth. <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s the Sixth. <hi>Selim</hi>'s the Seventh, who took <hi>Egypt. Phati-jame</hi> the Eighth, which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly a Chriſtian Church, dedicated to the Apoſtles, and allowed the Patriarch for the Patriarchal Church, upon the taking of the City;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:95495:61"/>but was afterwards ſeized upon again by that Tyrant, and prophaned by the execrable Impiety of the Impoſture, againſt <hi>God,</hi> and His <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

            </figure>
            <p>From the Hippodrome we walked a good way South-wards, to ſee another antient Pillar of white Marble; which,<note place="margin">THE PILLAR OF HONORI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>US AND AR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CADIUS.</note> becauſe it is carved from top to bottom, with a Baſſo-relievo, expreſſing ſome War-like Actions of the Emperour <hi>Arcadius,</hi> is therefore called the Hiſtorical Pillar. It hath a winding pair of Stairs, to go to the Top of it; but they are much broken; ſo that, we could not have that Satisfaction. It is very like thoſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> of the Emperours <hi>Trajan</hi> and <hi>Antonine;</hi> but I will not compare its Baſſo-relievo to theirs, for Excellency of Work: Although great Art hath been ſhewn, to make the Figures ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear of an equal Bigneſs to the Eye, at all the Diſtances; and, to give it its due, is far better than the uſual Carving of theſe latter Times. The Heighth that <hi>P. Jilius</hi> took of it, was One hundred and forty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Foot, which excels that of <hi>Trajan</hi>'s by Nineteen <hi>Roman</hi> Feet; but <hi>Antonine</hi>'s Pillar is higher than this, by thirteen Foot. Three ſides of the Baſis are carved with Trophies; and, on the Northern-ſide, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, was an Inſcription; but quite eaten away by that penetrating Wind. On the South-ſide, on the higheſt part of the Baſis, in a Wreath, ſuſtained by two Victories, is the <hi>Labarum;</hi> which is a Knot, conſiſting of the firſt Letters of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which the Chriſtian Emperours, from <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> placed in their Banners, inſtead of the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagle. Below that, are the Effigies of the Emperours, <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Arcadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us;</hi> to the Honour of whom this Pillar was Erected, crowned with flying Victories, and accompanied by many of their Nobility. On the Third Rank are ſeveral Victories; ſome Leading, and others Driving;
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:95495:62"/>ſeveral Figures, each crowned with a Crown, much repreſenting ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Cities conquered by thoſe Emperours.</p>

It hath ſuffered much by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Fires, happening near it; and thence, now it is called the Burnt Pillar. It was brought hither by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> from <hi>Rome;</hi> but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, being tumbled down, it was Re-built by <hi>Manuel Comenus;</hi> as we learned by an Inſcription, engraven round the top; which, by the Help of a ſmall Proſpective Glaſs, we read, and thus copied:

            <p>Our Guide, to ſhew us the Curioſities of this Place, told us,<note place="margin">MARCIAN'S PILLAR.</note> He knew of another Pillar in the City, which no Stranger had yet ſeen; in which, I believe, he told true; for I find none that have taken notice of it, before us: It is the Monument of the Emperour <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cianus,</hi> as the Inſcription on the Baſis informed us; although hard to be read, by reaſon the Letters were made of ſome Mettal; which is all picked off, and the Holes only, with ſome ſtrokes of the Letters, now remain. The Baſis, and Pillar, is of Granite Marble; but the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital is of white, and of the <hi>Corinthen</hi> Order. On the top is an Urn of white Marble, carved at the Corners with Eagles. We judged, it might contain his Heart, becauſe the Burning of dead Bodies was never uſed by Chriſtians. The Inſcription intimates, that the Statue of this Emperour was there placed, I ſuppoſe, on the Top of the Pillar, on the Urn; and that <hi>Tatianus</hi> erected this Monument, who was undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly the ſame that aſſured him, he ſhould be Emperour, when as yet he was but a private Souldier; having with his Brother <hi>Julio,</hi> ſeen an Eagle ſit over him, and ſhadowing him from the Sun with his Wings, when he was fallen aſleep in the Field, being wearied with Hunting: For which, ſo ſoon as the Event verified the good Omen, he made <hi>Tatianus</hi> Governour of the City, and <hi>Julio</hi> he made Governour of the Province of <hi>Illyria. Zonaras</hi> gives him the Character of an Excellent Prince; in whoſe time <hi>Arſenius</hi> was Patriarch of <hi>conſtantinople,</hi> and by whoſe Command, Favour, and Protection, the Fourth General Council was aſſembled, and held at <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> wherein the Hereſies of <hi>Eutyches</hi> and <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> were condemned, and the Verity of the Divine and Humane Nature of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> without Confuſion of Subſtance, was aſſerted. This Pillar is now ſtanding in the Court of a private Houſe,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:95495:63"/>joyning to the Bath of <hi>Ibrahim Baſha,</hi> near the <hi>Odas</hi> of the Janizaries, which is about Mid-way between the <hi>Hippodrome</hi> and <hi>Adrianople</hi> Gate, not far from the great Street.</p>
            <p>When we were in this part of the Town,<note place="margin">THE JANI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZARIES QUARTERS.</note> we went to ſee the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Janizaries, which are two great Buildings near together, without any great Beauty or Ornament; but capable of receiving of a great number of Men; where all that Order ought to inhabit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and live Batchellors: But now they leave off the ſtrictneſs of that Diſcipline, great part of them having only their Names enrolled in their Books, and receive the Grand Signior's Pay; but Marry, follow Trades, and reſide in their own Houſes, up and down the Town. They are two oblong Courts, with a ſmall Moſque, or Chappel, in the middle of them, where thoſe that reſide there, daily do their Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of Inns in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
               <note place="margin">KANS.</note> and indeed all over <hi>Turkey,</hi> they have publick Buildings, they call <hi>Karavan Serais,</hi> or <hi>Kans,</hi> erected in convenient Parts of the City for the Markets, and Traffick of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Commodities. Theſe are for all Men of what Quality, Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Country, or Religion ſoever; and there the Pooreſt have room to lodge in, and the Richeſt have no more: As to their Beds and Entertainment, they muſt bring and provide them themſelves, or lodge on the Floor, or (at moſt) on a Mat; which, in ſome <hi>Kans,</hi> the Kan-keeper is obliged to provide.</p>
            <p>They are of two ſorts; the old Faſhion ones are but like a great Barn, without any Partitions, or Diſtinctions of Rooms or Lodgings: They have only round the Wall, a Bank raiſed about a Foot and half high from the Ground, kept from falling down by a Wall of the ſame height, paved on the Top, and about ſeven or eight Foot broad. At four or five Yards diſtance round the Wall, are placed ſmall Chimneys: Between which, they lay their Beds; tying their Horſes, and giving them Meat at their Feet.</p>
            <p>But the other <hi>Kans,</hi> of later Building, and in great Cities, are more ſtately; they are uſually built in the Form of a Quadrangle, with Two, and ſometimes Three Stories one above the other; covered with ſo many Leaded Cuppaloes, as it is divided into Appartments, of about ten Foot ſquare; where each Company keep their Concerns private to themſelves, with as great Convenience as their manner of Life will permit. And about them, there are commonly Attendance; who, for a ſmall Vale, will provide you ſuch things as you have Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for. So many Stories as they are high, ſo many Galleries are built one above another, round the <hi>Kan,</hi> into which theſe little Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers open.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Kans</hi> look very ſtately without, and are not ungrateful to the Sight within; They are uſually built of Stone, having a large Gate to enter into them; and in the middle of the Area, is built a ſmall Moſque, or Chappel, to do their Devotion in; ſupply'd with Water both for Religious, and Neceſſary Uſes. In my Opinion, they might be accommodated to the Uſe of our Chriſtian Countries. For the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Inns, Taverns, and Ale-houſes are grown ſuch Places of all manner of Debaucheries, that I am ſure, they are become the Shame of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:95495:63"/>our Religion, if not of the Policies of moſt Chriſtian Countries: For they not only harbour Prophaneneſs, Luxury, and Debauchery; but are the Receptacles of idle and ſlothful Perſons; and indeed, of Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanes, Thieves, and Robbers: Their Keepers extorting for their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, Rates without Reaſon or Modeſty; and, in a word, are the Deſtruction of the Souls, Bodies, and Eſtates of many Thouſands, not only of Poor, but Rich alſo; and when all this is done, they oftner die Beggars, than Rich Men themſelves: Whereas, if ſuch Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as theſe were erected in convenient Places of the Roads, in Cities, and in Market-Towns, and put into the Hands of honeſt poor Men, to ſerve Strangers, Travellers, and Tradeſmen: Poor Men might do their Buſineſs with greater Expedition, and leſs Charge; carry home their Gains to their Wives and Children, and not ſpend them before they return from Market. Here Rich Men might have provided for the neceſſary Conveniences of their Journeys without Extravagances, have Opportunity to be Charitable, and by their Examples of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Chriſtian Behaviour, give Glory to <hi>God</hi> their Creatour, and mighty Redeemer: eſpecially if they had Chappels and Chaplains, with a convenient Stipend annexed to them.</p>
            <p>The Exchange, which they call the <hi>Bazar,</hi> or <hi>Bezeſtan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">BAZAR.</note> is alſo a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Building, roofed with Cuppalo's, covered with Lead, ſuſtained by many Arches and Pillars within, and is ſituate toward the Weſtern part of the City. The chief Trade in it, conſiſting in Fur-Gowns, Veſts, fine Saddles and Bridles, Semiters, and other Armour. We ſoon wiſhed our ſelves out of it; it was ſo crouded with Brokers that ſold old Cloaths, we apprehended were of thoſe who dyed of the Plague.</p>
            <p>The Publick Bagnios, or Baths,<note place="margin">BAGNIOS.</note> are none of the ſmalleſt Ornaments of this City. Theſe are uſually placed near their Moſques, becauſe they uſe them in cleanſing themſelves, according to their Superſtition, as well as for the Health of their Bodies; being their chief Remedy in all their Diſeaſes, as really they are the beſt Phyſick of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. We went to ſee only one of theſe near the Moſque of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's Mother; becauſe the Plague was ſo much in the City, and theſe much frequented by the Infected. They have a Room without, with a Sopha round it, to undreſs themſelves; and a large ſquare Room beyond that, covered with a Cuppalo, thorough which the Light is let by Bell-glaſſes; and about it are many little Appartments, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſmall Cuppalo's, much reſembling that built in <hi>London;</hi> only they have uſually a great Baſon in the Middle, filled with hot Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, into which they go to bathe themſelves.</p>
            <p>We croſſed the Water one day, to ſee the Antient Aqueduct,<note place="margin">OLD AQUEDUCT.</note> that joyns the two Hills together; on which the Moſques of <hi>Suleman,</hi> and <hi>Bajazet</hi> ſtand; of which we had a fair Proſpect from <hi>Gallata.</hi> It is built ſtrong and high, with large Arches one above the other, in the deepeſt part of the Valley: but is now diſ-joyned from the Eaſtern Hill, and of no preſent Uſe. The Water being now conveyed about the City by Pipes under Ground: But the Aqueducts, that bring the Water to the City, are very Magnificent; of which, more hereafter.</p>
            <p>We took a Barge another day, and went to ſee the Seven Towers,<note place="margin">SEVEN TOWERS.</note>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:95495:64"/>as they call a Caſtle ſituate in that Angle of the City neareſt the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pontis,</hi> becauſe it bath ſo many eminent Spired Towers.</p>
            <p>In our way, we put a Shore on the Seraglio point; where towards the <hi>Boſphorus</hi> is a Plat-form, planted with a great many Cannons, the Spoils taken in their Wars from the Chriſtians, and <hi>Perſians;</hi> ſome we obſerved with ſuch a vaſt Bore, as are capable to fling Stones of near ten foot diameter: Near this Point we obſerved ſeveral Rocks and Shelves, lying but little below the Surface of the Water; which muſt needs be very dangerous to any Veſſels, that either by the Wind or Current ſhall be drove upon them. When we came to the Seven Towers, we were not permitted Entrance, by reaſon that a Knight of <hi>Malta</hi> had made his Eſcape thence not long before; whereupon it was ordered, that no Franck ſhould enter there any more. We were only permitted to go round it; and all we obſerved, was an antient Gate, looking towards the <hi>Propontis,</hi> adorned with Baſſo-relievo's on oblong Tables of white Marble. On one is the Fall of <hi>Phaeton,</hi> on another <hi>Hercules</hi> fighting with a Bull, on another <hi>Hercules</hi> in combat with <hi>Cerberus;</hi> and on another, <hi>Venus</hi> coming to viſit <hi>Adonis</hi> ſleeping; with ſome others we knew not what they ſignified. This Gate is now quite ſtopped up, and no Entrance that way. Hard by, over a little Gate of the City, which from the <hi>Boſphorus</hi> leads to the Seven Towers, we obſerved this Inſcription, with the Letters curiouſly joyned to each other in knots, hardly to be explicated:
<q>ΑΝΕΚΑΙΝΙΣΘΕ ΕΠΙ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΟΥ ΚΑΙ ΚΟΝΣΤΑΝΤΙΝΟΥ ΤΩΝ ΠΟΡΦΥΡΟΓΕΝΝΗΤΩΝ<lb/>
Π ΘΙΛΟΧΡΙΣΤΩΝ ΚΑΙ ΤΩΝ ΔΕΣΠΟ ΤΩΝ ΠΕΝ ΕΤΕ Κ. Φ. Κ. Α.†</q>
Which imports, that the Gate was rebuilt by <hi>Baſilius</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine Porphyrogenites;</hi> Emperours in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the year —</p>
            <p>This Place looks not ſtrong enough for a Caſtle, but is ſufficiently ſo for a Priſon; which is the Imployment they now put it to, and that only for great Men, or great Malefactors, like the Tower of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So ſoon as our Convenience would permit,<note place="margin">PATRIARCH AT BALLATA.</note> we went to wait on the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who was then named <hi>Parthenius;</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him the Preſent of Books, which we had received from the Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pappa of <hi>Corfu</hi> for him; and to ſee in what ſtate ſo great a Prelate of the Church lived, and was reduced to. His Palace and Church is at a quarter of the Town called <hi>Ballata,</hi> which muſt not be miſtaken for <hi>Gallata:</hi> It is ſituated near the Weſtern Corner of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning to the Harbour, and is allotted to the Patriarch and <hi>Greek</hi> Chriſtians. We ſaluted him at his coming out of the Church, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Greek</hi> Cuſtom, with low Reverence, kiſſing his Hand, or Chappelet; firſt putting it to the Mouth, and then to the Fore-head. His uſual Habit differeth not from the ordinary <hi>Caloyers,</hi> or Monks of the Order of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Baſil;</hi> out of which the Biſhops, and Patriarchs are choſen; it being a black ſerge Caſſock, or Veſt, down to the ground, a black Cap, with a black Cypreſs, or curled Scarf wound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; as the other Biſhops and <hi>Egoumeno's,</hi> or Abbots, often do
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:95495:64"/>wear. He liveth but obſcurely; his Palace being no better, than the worſer ſort of our Parſonage Houſes. The Patriarchal Church is but a ſmall, obſcure Edifice, without any great Ornament or Beauty. For the <hi>Greek</hi> Church is trampled upon here, as well as in all other the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Dominions. They keep in it part of the Pillar (they ſay) our Saviour was tied to, when ſcourged by <hi>Pontius Pilate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Patriarchs depend on the Grand Signior, both as to their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Civil Juriſdiction: For they are likewiſe Judges in Civil Matters, between Chriſtian and Chriſtian. They buy this Dignity dear, and poſſeſs it with great hazard: Yet ſo ambitious are the <hi>Greek</hi> Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of it, that the Biſhops are always buying it over one anothers Heads, from the Grand Vizier; who deſires no better Sport, than to ſee them ſtrive who ſhall bring moſt Griſts to his Mill. They pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe this Dignity with very great Sums of Money; which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to be preſſed out of the poor <hi>Greek</hi> Chriſtians: and when obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is no longer ſecured to them, than till the Ambition of another Biſhop offers more for it, or impeacheth this Incumbent with Crimes ſufficient for a Pretext to diſpoſſeſs him: Which the Vizier greedily catcheth at, (right or wrong) to the Ruin of the preſent Poſſeſſor: Yet the Biſhops are ſtill canvaſing for it; inſomuch, that in the ſpace of five Years, they had changed the Patriarch five times; ſome of them being executed, and others having made their Eſcape; of whom I ſaw one at <hi>Zant,</hi> and another (they ſay) is at <hi>Smyrna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Authority which they thus obtain by Simony, they maintain by Tyranny: For as ſoon as they are promoted, they ſend to all their Biſhops, to contribute to the Sum they have disburſed for their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment; and ſuch as deny, they depoſe, and ſend others to their Charge. Again, the Biſhops ſend to their inferiour Clergy; who are forced to do the ſame to the poor People, or to ſpare it out of their Wives and Childrens Mouths. But many times they engage for more, than they can perform; and bring the Church ſo much in debt to the <hi>Turk,</hi> that its Ruin is daily threatned thereby; which, without <hi>God</hi>'s great Mercy uphold it, cannot long ſubſiſt. I was informed, that <hi>Patriarch Parthenius</hi> was then owing fifty Purſes of Dollers, each Purſe containing five hundred; which amounteth to twenty five thouſand, making in Engliſh Money about ſix thouſand pound: which to raiſe in the great Poverty that Church is in, will be a greater dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to him, than it was to be made Patriarch. We had but a ſhort Conference with his <hi>All holineſs,</hi> which is the Title they give him in Diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>It would be pertinent in this Place, to give ſome ſhort View of the State, and Religion of this Church: But that Subject having been ſo amply and ingenuouſly handled by Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ricaut,</hi> I
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:95495:65"/>ſhall only at preſent make ſome Remarks on their Opinion of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt; which has been ſo much and long controverted between late Writers of the Romiſh and Proteſtant Church: and that I ſhall do with the ſame Sincerity and Frankneſs, as I had my Informations from Biſhops, <hi>Caloyers,</hi> and other Religious Men of that Communion, with whom I converſed in ſeveral places of my Journey.</p>
            <p>The Euchariſt, or Holy Communion, is the Sacrament, in which they ſhew moſt of their Devotion; it being the chiefeſt Part of their Religious Worſhip; wherein they expreſs the whole Myſtery of the Goſpel, as the Death, Paſſion, Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> into Heaven.</p>

            <p>As to their Faith concerning this Myſtery, I cannot take upon me to determine: For it hath been a Queſtion well handled already between two learned Men of the Roman and Reformed Churches of <hi>France, viz.</hi> Monſieur <hi>Arnauld,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Claud;</hi> by whom Authors have been examined with much Diligence on both ſides: Wherein Monſieur <hi>Claud</hi> ſeemeth to be victorious from their Writings, and the Reports of Travellers of this laſt Age: Though by a new Confeſſion, brought about by the Marqueſs <hi>de Nanteulle,</hi> French Ambaſſador now at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> (who with great Zeal did proſecute that Deſign) Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> ſeemeth to triumph: Of which the World will have an Account one day, I hope, from Dr. <hi>Covel,</hi> who was Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain to the Engliſh Ambaſſadour, Sir <hi>John Finch,</hi> at the ſame time when that Buſineſs was acted, and hath particularly informed himſelf about it. Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> perſwades the World, That they do believe the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> and <hi>Tranſubstantiation:</hi> Monſieur <hi>Claud</hi> affirmeth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>However, I think, it is an hard Queſtion to determine of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Faith; and of very little conſequence, unleſs they could prove that they ever did believe <hi>Tranſubstantiation:</hi> which will be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be done, as is apparent from what Monſieur <hi>Claud</hi> hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten concerning that Subject. It will be very difficult to prove it their preſent Belief, becauſe they are ſo very unlearned, that they hardly know the Principles of their Faith; and I could not find, that <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubstantiation</hi> hath been heard of, except amongſt thoſe that have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with the Roman Church. <hi>Of little conſequence</hi> I ſay: For, What Argument can it be againſt the ſure Foundations of the Reformed Churches, to have prevailed upon the groſs Ignorance of that poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed Nation, by impoſing thoſe Opinions upon them, as if they had been from the Beginning the Doctrines of their Church, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ever agreed with that of <hi>Rome.</hi> This Fruit indeed, the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries (and Miſſioners from them in all places of theſe Parts) may bring forth: And it were to be wiſhed, that the Proteſtant Princes had been as diligent to have informed them in the Truth. But it is the Fortune <hi>of the Children of Darkneſs</hi> to be cunninger in this World, than the <hi>Children of Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had not very frequent Opportunity, to examine this Matter well; but where I had, I commonly did. At <hi>Corfu</hi> and <hi>Zant;</hi> they are moſt certainly of the <hi>Roman</hi> Opinion, as to this; although profeſſed Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and Pope, in the points of Infallibility, and Proceſſion of the Holy Spirit. At <hi>Tine</hi> they are moſt of the <hi>Roman</hi>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:95495:66"/>Religion; and the <hi>Greeks</hi> uſe their own Liturgies and Ceremonies; but are governed by a <hi>Latine</hi> Biſhop. <hi>Micone</hi> hath a <hi>Greek</hi> Biſhop, and is ſubject to the Patriarch. The Biſhop of it, then reigning, came to <hi>Constantinople</hi> with us; but for want of Language, I had but little diſcourſe with him: But he had a Prieſt waiting on him, that ſpoke <hi>Italian;</hi> with whom I ſometimes diſcourſed. He talked, as if he had never heard of ſuch Doctrine; much leſs believed, that the Bread by Conſecration was really changed into the Body of <hi>Christ;</hi> and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed plainly to underſtand a Myſtical and Spiritual Senſe in it.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Athens</hi> I often converſed with the Arch-Biſhop, who was then one called <hi>Antenos.</hi> He affirmed to me, That he was preſent at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> when the Patriarch ſigned that Writing to the Marqueſs of <hi>Nanteulle,</hi> that he was one of that Aſſembly himſelf, and that they believed according to that Writing; wherein the Article of <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation</hi> is expreſſed by that word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, though I do not find, that ever that word was known till then, to the <hi>Greek</hi> Church:) I asked him, Whether he did not underſtand it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (Spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?) he anſwered no; but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Corporally; that is to ſay, <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>corporally</hi> in the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Whilſt I was at the Convent of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Luke</hi>'s by <hi>Livadia</hi> in <hi>Boeotia,</hi> there happened to come thither the Biſhop of <hi>Salona;</hi> with whom I had frequent diſcourſe upon that Subject. He ſeemed deſirous, when I told him, That I was of <hi>England,</hi> to know the Faith of our Church; of which, when I had given him the beſt Account I could, he told me, that it was the ſame with theirs: For I informed him, That we believed the Holy Scriptures, the Apoſtles Creed, the <hi>Nicene,</hi> and that of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> That our Church was governed by Biſhops and Arch-Biſhops; That our Faith was conformable to the Primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and the firſt General Councils, until the firſt five or ſix Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and in fine, That we were not of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. After this, I asked him their Opinion concerning the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and what they held the Bread and Wine to be after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration; he anſwered, The Body and Blood of Chriſt. When I asked him, <hi>How that could be?</hi> he gave me this Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; As the Sun is in Heaven, and yet gives Light and Heat to the whole Earth; ſo Chriſt, although in Heaven, yet was in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by his Divine Power and Influence. I told him, <hi>That that was as we believed;</hi> which was, that Chriſt was in the Sacrament after a ſpiritual manner. He ſaid, It was the ſame the <hi>Greek</hi> Church believed; and was ſo obliging to me thereupon, that he would needs have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained me Prieſt the next day; which, as it is really the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Employment a Chriſtian can be capable of; ſo amongſt them it is moſt highly eſteemed: and I had much adoe to excuſe my ſelf, by acknowledging my Unworthineſs of ſo great an Honour.</p>
            <p>This was the general Judgment of that whole Covent, and of an Hermit, that liveth about a Mile from thence in great auſterity, and held by them to be a Saint. There was a Father, who was Native of <hi>Zant;</hi> but came away from thence ſo young, that he was not imbued with their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples there. When I asked him, Whether they believed that the Bread and Wine was changed into the Body and Blood of Chriſt? he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:95495:66"/>me, Whether I thought them ſo much Beaſts, as to believe ſuch an Abſurdity? The only thing they ſeemed moſt to diſlike in us, and our Religion, was, That I would not make any Reverence to the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures that are in their Churches; which they always do, when they come to their Devotions. They never kneel in their Worſhip; but bend their Bodies down to the Ground, making the Sign of the Croſs with their right hand, firſt on their Head, then on each ſide of their Breaſts, and then down to the Ground, as they bow.</p>
            <p>I believe that this Convent, and the moſt inland Parts of <hi>Greece,</hi> are yet free from that Opinion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and have not been tamper'd with by them.</p>
            <p>I have made no other Remarks of the <hi>Turks</hi> Religion,<note place="margin">TURKS RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIGION and LEARNING.</note> but what have been already obſerved. Mr. <hi>Watſon,</hi> a Scotchman, who hath tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled thoſe Parts for four or five Years together, and hath perfected himſelf in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> and <hi>Arabian</hi> Languages, ſurprized my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and me with an Account he gave of their Learning, beyond the ordinary Opinion of the World. He aſſured us, That at <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> there was a <hi>Bazar</hi> (or Exchange) for Manuſcript Books (for they ſuffer no Printing) of different Sciences, in the <hi>Turkiſh, Arabian,</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> Languages; the two laſt beeing their learned Languages, as <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> are in Chriſtendom; but that it was dangerous for Chriſtians to frequent them; as Monſieur <hi>Spon</hi> was made ſenſible, when we paſſed by <hi>Proſa.</hi> For ſeeing ſome <hi>Arabick</hi> Manuſcripts, he would have cheapned them; but was reproachfully ſent away with the Name of <hi>Goure,</hi> or <hi>Infidel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Watſon</hi> aſſured us, that they keep annual Regiſters of all things that paſs throughout the whole Extent of their Empire; and of the Wars they have with their Neighbouring Countries: That one might have a Copy of theſe Annals in five or ſix great Volums, for Two hundred Crowns: That there are Hiſtorians and Writers, who have a Salary for writing, in the Seraglio: That there was another good Book to be had, concerning the Government of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire; and that he himſelf had bought a Cheſt full of <hi>Turkiſh</hi> and <hi>Arabian</hi> Books; among which he had many very rare pieces; as one of <hi>Chek-Bouni,</hi> an Egyptian, concerning the Vertue of <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Human Words,</hi> full of Figures and Lines; by which he pretends to do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of curious tricks by <hi>Anagrams.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another that ſheweth the Theory of the Cabaliſtick Art. A Dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in <hi>Turkiſh</hi> and <hi>Arabick:</hi> A Book of Songs, wherein there are many very antient ones, as of <hi>Avicen</hi> and <hi>Albucherche; Turkiſh</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> Grammers, with Alphabets of all Languages. A Book of all the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of the Kingdom of <hi>Egypt,</hi> written by a Cheke, or Doctor of Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> a great Aſtrologer; whoſe Predictions have alwayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo true, that when <hi>Sultan Selim</hi> made War againſt the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> all that King's Counſellors told him, That it was but Folly to reſiſt, (although he had a very puiſſant Army, conſiſting of <hi>Moors, Arabs,</hi> and <hi>Mammalucks</hi>) becauſe, according to this Book, <hi>Selim</hi> was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer <hi>Egypt:</hi> which accordingly came to paſs. He ſhewed us alſo a Book, that he ſaid was a Calculation of the ſeveral Degrees of the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:95495:67"/>overflowing of the River of <hi>Nilus,</hi> regulated according to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Planets, eſpecially of the <hi>Moon;</hi> by an <hi>Arabian</hi> Doctor. Another of Chiromancy, more curious than thoſe of <hi>John Battiſta Porta:</hi> In which the Author pretends, That the Characters of the Hands are Letters; of which he gives the Alphabet. He alſo told us of another, called <hi>Bauraan,</hi> an antient Author, containing abundance of Chimical Experiments; commented on by a Cheke, who was a <hi>Moor,</hi> with whom he was acquainted at Grand <hi>Cairo:</hi> Where he aſſured us, there were abundance of very conſiderable Perſons, who applyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to this Study, and moſt other Sciences. At another time, he ſhewed us the Hiſtory of <hi>Tamerlan</hi> in <hi>Arabick,</hi> more ample than that Tranſlated out of the <hi>Arabick</hi> of <hi>Alhacen.</hi> Two Books of <hi>Taliſman</hi>'s, teaching their Principles and Practice; out of which he affirmeth, That Monſieur <hi>Gaffarelle</hi> had borrowed all he had written in his Book of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nheard of Curioſities:</hi> That <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> had ſtollen all his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Arguments for the <hi>Truth of the Chriſtian Religion</hi> out-of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> Authors; and particularly, from the Works of an Eminent Man, whom the <hi>Latins</hi> hold to be an Arch-Heretick: But the <hi>Cofty</hi>'s, a Saint, who wrote an excellent Book againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> for the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion. And what is more to be wondered at, he aſſured us, That he had ſeen an antient Book of Aſtronomy, which did ſuppoſe the <hi>Magnetick Needle;</hi> although he did not apply it to Navigation, but to other Aſtrological uſes. He ſhewed us alſo a general Hiſtory of Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> and a Deſcription of all the Churches of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> at the time it was taken by the <hi>Turks;</hi> both writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in <hi>Arabick.</hi> Laſtly, He told us, That both at Grand <hi>Cairo</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> there were publick Profeſſors, that taught Aſtrology, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomy, Geometry, Arithmetick, Poetry, the <hi>Arabian</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.</p>
            <p>When we were at this Corner of the Town,<note place="margin">CONSTAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINE'S PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LACE.</note> we went to an old Building, they ſay was <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Palace; which ſtands upon the higheſt Ground, on that ſide of the City; for from the Harbour to it, is an Aſcent, and thence towards the Seven Towers the Ground a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain deſcends. What remains of it, expreſſes no Magnificence; being only a long Stone building, with a Hall ſuſtained by Pillars, and ſome Rooms over it.</p>
            <p>Without the Walls, from hence to the Seven Towers, on the Brow of the Hill, is a good Walk; but the Valley Weſt-wards of it, being only the burying Place of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> makes it ſomewhat Melancholly. Among theſe, here and there towards the Haven, are ſome Monuments of <hi>Turks</hi> of Quality, of white Marble, ſhaded with Plane Trees, and Cypreſs Trees.</p>
            <p>Here we went to ſee that of <hi>Sultan Eliub,</hi>
               <note place="margin">SULTAN ELIUB'S TOMB.</note> near the Harbour, whom they eſteem as a Prophet, and great Saint; and therefore, it is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Zealous <hi>Turks,</hi> with a great deal of Devotion. The Tomb is covered with a kind of Canopy, hung with Green, and many Lamps continually burning about it. Without is a ſmall Quadrangle, with a Portico and Gallery encompaſſing it, and a little Chappel in the middle. Here the Grand Signior is inaugurated, only by the Ceremony of a Sword girt about him by the <hi>Mufti;</hi> ſignifying that his Authority con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:95495:67"/>in the Power he hath obtained by that, and by that muſt ſtill be maintained. We obſerved near this Angle of the City, where the Water falls into a Ciſtern, and thence conveyed into other adjacent Parts of the Town.</p>
            <p>There are no Suburbs of Buildings contiguous to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
               <note place="margin">THE HARBOUR.</note> the Walls ſtanding, being bare all round the three ſides; but inſtead thereof, it hath over the Water great and populous Towns and Cities; which we obſerved with great pleaſure in our Return, as they lay all in view round about the Harbour: Whereof the North-ſide of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> encompaſſeth the South, and South-Weſt Shore. To which <hi>Scutari,</hi> on the <hi>Aſian</hi> Shore, ſeems to be joyned Eaſt-wards; and to <hi>Scutari</hi> on the <hi>Thracian</hi> Shore, <hi>Tophana, Fondoucli,</hi> and <hi>Gallata:</hi> And to <hi>Gallata,</hi> ſome Suburbs appertaining to it, where they kill their Meat; beyond which are Buildings, and dry Harbours, to keep the Gallies from the Weather in the Winter. Theſe bound the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour on the North-Eaſt, North, and North-Weſt ſides. All theſe Buildings riſing by Degrees, higher and higher, from the ſeveral Shores, to the tops of conſiderable high and ſteep Hills, make the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour look like a vaſt <hi>Naumachia,</hi> giving a moſt Magnificent Spectacle to the Beholders into it. At the further end, which lies North-Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, a ſmall River of freſh Water emptieth it ſelf; whoſe Banks are adorned with ſeveral pleaſant Gardens, and ſhady Trees. But the Beauty is not the only Excellency of this Harbour; for I believe, it alſo excells moſt in the World for Security and Capacity. It hath more depth than is needful, good Moorage, and ſo bold a Shore, that the greateſt Ship may be tyed by the Bolt Sprit on Shore, at <hi>Gallata,</hi> and unlade; and yet have ſeveral Fathoms of Water under her Keel. And I have obſerved ſome Merchant Ships lying with the ſide ſo near the Shore, that they went on Board, and on Shore, by a Plank be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. Which I was ſorry to ſee, one being a Genueſe infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Plague, that lay within fifteen or twenty Yards of our Lodging; being a Building on the Harbour, ſeparated from all others, without the Wall of <hi>Gallata;</hi> which our Landlord had provided us, upon the firſt notice of the Infection ſeizing on the Houſe adjoyning to his, within the Walls: For it was at <hi>Gallata</hi> we lodged, during our ſtay at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> at the Houſe of an honeſt <hi>Jew</hi> called <hi>Abram Finch,</hi> who ſerved the Engliſh Nation in Buſineſs, and us, both in the nature of Guide, and Drayoman, better than moſt <hi>Turks</hi> could: But when we made Viſits to any of Quality, we took alſo a Janizary; and this was, becauſe we had no Letters of Recommendation to any other; not thinking of going any further than <hi>Athens,</hi> when we firſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took this Voyage from <hi>Venice.</hi> Beſides the Plague being there ſo hot, we judged it unreaſonable to intrude our ſelves into the Houſes of any of our Country-men, ſince our Curioſity led us every where, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſideration of Danger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gallata</hi> is ſituate upon the South-ſide of a conſiderable ſteep Hill,<note place="margin">GALLATA</note> jetting out into a Promontory on the North-ſide of the Harbour; and comprehending the Suburbs on the Eaſt, Weſt, and North-ſides of it, may be counted a good large City, and very populous. Yet the Circumference of the Walls take up no great ſpace of Ground; but
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:95495:68"/>the Houſes are thick, and the Streets narrow, and the whole very populous. On the top of the Hill, is a round ſpired Tower, covered with Lead; and on the Wall we obſerved ſome Arms, and modern Inſcriptions, which upon inquiry, we found to belong to thoſe of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua;</hi> who ſometime before the taking of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> were Maſters of this Place.</p>
            <p>This City is peopled more by Chriſtians and <hi>Jews,</hi> than it is by <hi>Turks:</hi> And here is the Scale of the Merchants; who have a good Kan, covered with Lead in Cuppaloes; where they expoſe their Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Cloaths, they call Londros, and other Merchandize to ſale.</p>
            <p>On the North-ſide of <hi>Gallata,</hi>
               <note place="margin">PERA.</note> without the Walls, are the Suburbs, called by the Greeks <hi>Pera;</hi> which ſignifies beyond: by which Name they ſometimes comprehend <hi>Gallata,</hi> and all the adjacent Habitations, being beyond the Harbour from <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and therefore they call that Paſſage <hi>Perami, Trajectus,</hi> or the Paſſage; and the Boats that carry them, <hi>Peramidia.</hi> There is one good large Street running North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, with ſeveral that croſs it; and there dwell the foreign Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, Reſidents, and Envoys.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Finch,</hi> His Majeſties Ambaſſadour at the Port, was then at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> to have his Audience of the Grand Signior; and did not return hither, until about a Week or ten days before our Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But ſo ſoon as he did, he gave us frequent Opportunities of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him; and obliged us not only with his learned Converſation, but with many uſeful Informations alſo.</p>
            <p>We often went to viſit the Marqueſs of <hi>Nantel,</hi> Ambaſſadour of <hi>France;</hi> who with great Courteſie, entertained us with the Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Travails. He hath there about thirty Marbles, with antient Inſcriptions, and Baſſo-relievo's, brought from <hi>Athens,</hi> and the Iſles of the <hi>Archipelago;</hi> of which he permitted us to copy what we would. He hath alſo a great Number of Medals; among which are ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſingular. He ſhewed us abundance of Deſigns of Edifices, Baſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relievo's, and Proſpects of Countries, drawn by a Painter he ſtill car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him in his Travels in <hi>Turkey.</hi> All which, I hope, he will publiſh at his Return into <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Covel,</hi> then Chaplain to His Majeſty's Ambaſſadour there, among many Curioſities, ſhewed us ſome <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Songs, ſet to Muſick; which he told us, were both for Senſe and Muſick, very good; but paſt our Underſtanding. They were ſet by one <hi>Hulisbey,</hi> a Renegado, brought up in the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> His Native Country was <hi>Poland,</hi> and Chriſtian Name <hi>Albertus Bobovius.</hi> He was made a Slave when young; and now, diſmiſſed from the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> is become a principal Drugger-man, and can ſpeak (they ſay) ſeventeen Languages. If I remember right, Dr. <hi>Covel</hi> told me, It was the ſame, that gave Conſul <hi>Ricaut</hi> much light in his Treatiſe of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire. The Marqueſs of <hi>Nanteul</hi> hath a Deſcription of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> written by him in <hi>Italian,</hi> with many other curious things. Dr. <hi>Covel</hi> alſo ſhewed me many rare Medals, and antient Entaglos or Figures, cut on ſeveral ſorts of precious Stones; as alſo, many Deſcriptions of rare Plants and Animals; which he had curiouſly deſigned himſelf, being in that Art very ingenious, as well as a learned Divine.</p>
            <pb n="203" facs="tcp:95495:68"/>
            <p>We went ſometimes to ſee an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Surgeon,<note place="margin">OPIUM.</note> called <hi>Mahomet Baſha</hi> in the place <hi>Atmeydam;</hi> who informed us, That he was taken young, and made a Slave, and brought up in the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Here we ſaw the <hi>Turks</hi> come to take <hi>Opium,</hi> which they call <hi>Affion:</hi> They take it without any Preparation; it being meerly the Juyce of <hi>Black Poppy</hi> dried in the Sun, without any Purification: And it is wonderful, that Uſe ſhould make that which is Poiſon to us, a Cordial to them. The ill Effects that it hath upon them, is, that the immoderate Uſe of it in time doth doſe and ſtupifie them, contracts the Nerves, and makes them ſo round ſhoulder'd, that they become crooked. We ſaw many ſuch; and were told, That it was the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate uſe of <hi>Opium,</hi> which made them ſo. This Surgeon, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet Baſha,</hi> makes a good <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Phyſician; although his Skill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth not the making of Conſerves and Syrups, letting Blood, and ſome few good Wives Receipts. He hath ſome few ordinary Books in <hi>Engliſh, Italian,</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> and one in <hi>Arabick,</hi> which he much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; but how well he underſtood it, I am no competent Judge.</p>
            <p>We informed our ſelves alſo of the <hi>Ruſma,</hi> or <hi>Chriſme</hi> of the <hi>Turks;</hi>
               <note place="margin">RUSMA.</note> wherewith they uſed to take off the Hair of the Body without ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: For neither the Women nor Men, that pretend to Neatneſs, ſuffer any to grow upon their Bodies. They have two ſorts of it: One they make of quick Lime, and Orpiment; which they boyl to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Water, to the conſiſtence of an Oyntment: The other hath Lime, mixed with a kind of blackiſh Stone, that cometh out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſoft and pory, like a Pumice-Stone, and looketh ſomething like Cinders of Iron; ſome of it cometh from a place near <hi>Proſa</hi> in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolia.</hi> This they prepare like the other; and apply it, when they are at the Baths: and the Bath-keepers take great care to take it off, ſo ſoon as the Hair begins to come off eaſily. Then waſhing the place with hot Water, and rubbing it with a courſe Cloth, bringeth all the Hair off without doing the leaſt Hurt. We bought ſome of it at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where it is very cheap.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> is a place that aboundeth with all ſorts of Proviſions, whether Corn, Fleſh, or Fiſh; only Wine is ſcarce, by reaſon that it is prohibited. But though there be none permitted to be ſold in the City, at <hi>Gallata</hi> are ſome Chriſtian Cabarets; but the Wine is dear. They ſell it by weight here, and all over <hi>Turkey.</hi> The <hi>Oka,</hi> which is a weight of about forty two Ounces, is ſold here for a quarter of a Doller, that is about fourteen Pence, and contains about three Pints and an half, or two Quarts. The beſt Wine is made by the <hi>Jews,</hi> who by their Law muſt not make Mixtures. They have great plenty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſorts of good Fiſh. Oyſters here are better than I taſted them any where, except in <hi>England.</hi> The Sword-Fiſh is another I took notice of for its Goodneſs, and firm fleſhy Subſtance. Their Fruits are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent; Figs, Peaches, and Apples, very fair and good. The <hi>Turks</hi> are very ſweet-tooth'd, and love all kind of ſweet Meats: But I cannot commend them for good Confectioners. They preſerve Fruits with new Wine boyled to Syrup, Honey, and ſometimes Sugar; which although they are not ill-taſted, would hardly paſs with our <hi>Engliſh</hi>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:95495:69"/>Ladies, they are ſo ill-colour'd. Their moſt ordinary Drink is Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; next, a Sorbet made of Raiſins ſteeped in Water. But the Richer ſort have Sorbet made of Sugar and Honey boyled to a conſiſtence with the Juyce of lemons; which they mix with Water, when they uſe it. <hi>Coffee</hi> they drink at any time, but at Meal; and is the uſual En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, when any come to viſit them.</p>
            <p>About a dozen or fifteen Miles North from <hi>Gallata,</hi>
               <note place="margin">BELGRADE.</note> towards the Black Sea, we went to ſee a place, which from the Beauty and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs of it, is called <hi>Belgrade.</hi> The Country lies high, ſhaded with abundance of Woods, watered with many wholſom Springs, ſtored with ſeveral ſorts of Game, accommodated with ſeveral ſmall Villages, at convenient Diſtances, and the Air very good and healthful. To theſe ſhady Woods, many Perſons of Quality, as well of the <hi>Turks</hi> as Ambaſſadours, and rich Merchants; retire to enjoy the freſh Air in the ſcorching Heats of Summer, and to hunt at the proper Seaſons of the Year.</p>
            <p>Here ſome build them pretty Houſes of Pleaſure, others ſtately Chioſques, or Banquetting-Houſes; and others content themſelves to ſojourn in Tents, they ſtretch out under the tall Trees, near ſome refreſhing Spring. All theſe Springs are with great Care, and greater Charges, collected into ſeveral large Ciſterns; near each of which is built a ſtately Chioſque, or Summer-houſe. The uſual Form of them is ſquare, contrived ſo with large Pent-houſe-Roofs for ſhade; yet ſo open round about, that one enjoys all the Liverty, Freſhneſs, and Goodneſs of the open Air, without the leaſt Inconvenience from the heat of the Sun. You mount up to them by four or five Steps, to an Area paved with Purcelane Tile or Marble, covered with <hi>Indian</hi> Mats or Carpets, with Baluſters or Rails about it. The Roof alſo within, is painted with ſeveral Colours, as red, green, white, and yellow; and pretty Knots of Figures wrought on them.</p>
            <p>From theſe Ciſterns, the Water is conveyed by Channels under ground, to the ſeveral Aqueducts, that carry it by many Windings and Turnings over the low Valleys, from the tops of Hills to Hills; until at laſt it is brought with a vaſt Charge to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of theſe we obſerved, both in our way thither, and return to <hi>Gallata:</hi>
               <note place="margin">AUQEDUCTS</note> Eſpecially, one about mid-way, joyning two Hills together croſs a Valley, at leaſt half a Mile over. This conſiſts of two Ranges of Arches; whereof the lowermoſt hath fifty, and the uppermoſt fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one; and I believe, from the deepeſt part of the Valley, to the top of the Aqueduct, is above thirty Yards. There is another in ſight of this Eaſtwards, which bends and makes an Angle: This hath three Ranges of Arches one above the other, but not ſo many in number. North of this firſt, we ſaw another, which joyns two Hills together by a narrow, but very deep Valley. This hath but four Arches in two Tanges, but the Arches are exceedign large; I meaſured them not: but Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> ſaith, They are above fifty Foot wide. The Care of theſe Waters, and the cleanſing of theſe Aqueducts, and Channels, are impoſed upon the adjacent Villages; for which ſervice, they are freed from all other Taxes. Moſt of theſe Aqueducts were built by the latter <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Emperours: But by Time, Wars, and Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignece,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:95495:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>being run to decay and ruined, they were repaired again at the great Charge, and indefatigable Induſtry of <hi>Sultan Suliman;</hi> who for this, and the ſtately Moſque he built in the City, was deſervedly called the Magnificent. Theſe Waters being thus brought to the City, are again collected into ſeveral great Ciſterns; and thence again, by earthen Pipes, diſperſed to the ſeveral Quarters, private Houſes, and publick Buildings of the City: Whereof one is againſt the wall of the City by <hi>Ballata,</hi> another under <hi>Hagia-Sophia;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> ſpeaks of one at <hi>Sultan Selim</hi>'s Moſque.</p>
            <p>The Plants I took notice of hereabouts, were 1.<note place="margin">PLANTS.</note> A kind of <hi>Dwarf-Abrotonum,</hi> with Flowers like <hi>Cammonil.</hi> 2. A ſort of <hi>Serpillum,</hi> with Leaves like <hi>Savoury;</hi> the Smell alſo differing from ours.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>I found another Plant going thither, and to the Black-Sea alſo; which I know not to what <hi>ſpecies</hi> to refer, unleſs to <hi>Androſemum majus</hi> which we call <hi>Parks-Leaves:</hi> For the Leaves are of the ſubſtance and colour, only longer, and of a more tough Subſtance, growing two by two, on a ſhrubby ſquare Stalk, of a reddiſh colour, not riſing from the ground above a ſpan high: On the top of which ſucceedeth a large yellow Flower, much bigger than <hi>Parks-Leaves,</hi> filled with a large Tuft of the ſame; our of which, before the Flower is fallen, beginneth to riſe a long Veſſel, divided into five Appartments full of reddiſh Seeds. The Smell is like the beſt <hi>Turpentine;</hi> but more fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant, and like <hi>Coris.</hi> Of it I obſerved two ſorts: The difference is only, that the other by pairs croſs each other. It ſpreads upon the Ground in heaps; ſo that ſeldom one ſhall find one Stalk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
            <pb n="206" facs="tcp:95495:70"/>
            <p>Since my writing this, I find that Dr. <hi>Moriſon</hi> hath deſcribed this Plant in his excellent Hiſtory of Plants, having raiſed it in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanick Garden at <hi>Oxford,</hi> of which Science he is the Learned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour, out of the Seeds I ſent to that Univerſity; and hath named it, <hi>Androſemum Olympii montis flore &amp; ſemine Theca quinque capſulari ominum maximus:</hi> which is extreamly well diſtinguiſhed; only he ſhould have put in <hi>Byzantinum</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinopolitanum,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Montis Olympii;</hi> as he hath done lately in a Letter to me, with the Deſign of the Plant I here give you.</p>
            <p>I alſo there ſaw ſome Trees of <hi>Guaiacum Patavinum;</hi> which were ſhewed us as a Rarity at <hi>Pera.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We waited a good while for a calm Day, to go to the Mouth of the Black Sea, to ſee the Pillar vulgarly called <hi>Pompey</hi>'s <hi>Pillar:</hi> For the North-wind reigns much in that Sea; and when it bloweth, there is no paſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and the Stream. We took a good ſtrong Boat, with ſix Oars; and left on each hand, as we were turning the point of <hi>Gallata,</hi> many Villages, whoſe Situations are very pleaſant, with Rocks, Hills, and Promontories, covered with Cheſnuts, Olives, and Cypreſs Trees; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many of the <hi>Baſha</hi>'s, and other great Mens <hi>Seraglio</hi>'s, or <hi>Houſes of Pleaſure.</hi> I never ſaw more beautiful, nor greater Variety of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; where the Motion of the Boat each moment changeth the Scene. On the <hi>Thracian</hi> Shore, from <hi>gallata,</hi> are theſe: viz. <hi>Topha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Fondukli, Bechikroaſh, ORtaqui, Corout, Scheſme, Arnaudqui, Bubel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakchiſi, Eski-hiſſar</hi> or <hi>Old Caſtle, Bartoliman, Stegna, Jegniqui, Thera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, Boindore, Sariier, Fanari:</hi> where is a Light-Houſe juſt within the Mouth of the Sea, on the right hand; and on the Shore of <hi>Natolia,</hi> beginning from <hi>Scutari,</hi> are <hi>Couſch-couiouk, Stauros, Chenguetqui, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la bakchiſi, Candel-bakcheſi, Eski-hiſſar,</hi> or <hi>Old Castle</hi> of <hi>Natolia:</hi> both which defend theſe Streights from Incurſions from the <hi>Euxin,</hi> or <hi>Black\Sea, Guioſqui, Chiboucli, Inguirliqui, Oncliar, Skeloſi, Beicos, Salicevroun, Joro,</hi> in old time <hi>Fanum;</hi> becauſe probably it was a Light-Houſe in thoſe times. a little without the Entrance, on the left hand, is the Rock whereon ſtandeth the Pillar. It is of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Order, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Baſis,</hi> and both of white Marble; upon which is an Inſcription, that ſheweth it to have been dedicated to <hi>Augustus.</hi> But it is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and ſo worn with ſtanding bleak to the Winds, that to make any more of it, is paſt the Skill of the Antiquaries; ſome calling the laſt word <hi>PONTO,</hi> and ſome <hi>FRONTO.</hi> The other Lines are imperfect likewiſe: For at the beginning is a part of a Letter, that may be taken for either a <hi>C,</hi> or an <hi>O.</hi> If the firſt, it muſt be <hi>C. CAESARI AVGVSTO.</hi> But otherwiſe only, the end of a word, as by the <hi>E</hi> in the next line, ſeemeth very probable: And Mr. <hi>Sands</hi> maketh it it to be <hi>DIVO,</hi> as probably it was: So that the firſt line may be <hi>DIVO CAESARI AVGVSTO.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the next Line, I would conclude with Mr. <hi>Sands,</hi> That it is <hi>L. CLANNIDIVS,</hi> If I could have found any ſuch Name among the <hi>Roman</hi> Families: But I find only <hi>Annidius,</hi> And beſides my own, Monſieur <hi>Spon</hi>'s, and Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s Obſervation, make the firſt letter an <hi>E;</hi> and muſt therefore be the laſt letter in a word; as in many Inſcriptions I have ſeen <hi>E</hi> written for <hi>ET,</hi> and then I would put a
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:95495:70"/>point between <hi>C L.</hi> and <hi>Annidius;</hi> and then it would be for <hi>&amp; Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius Annidius:</hi> For <hi>C L.</hi> is put for <hi>Clandius,</hi> and not <hi>CLA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>.</hi> except there is a Praenomen before it.</p>
            <p>The laſt line is as much travers't as any. The firſt two letters that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> makes <hi>L E.</hi> are undoubtedly <hi>L. F. Luci Filius;</hi> as it is in Mr. <hi>Sands,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Spon</hi>'s, and my own Obſervation took upon the Place. As to the reſt, there is room enough for every one to have his Fancy. mr. <hi>Sands</hi> makes it <hi>CLAPONTO,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> interpreteth <hi>CLAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIS I PONTO;</hi> and ſo maketh it the Payment of a Vow of ſome, that had ſafely conducted their Navy through this dangerous Sea. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Spon</hi> makes it <hi>CLA. FRONTO.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what it can ſo ſignify, I cannot tell. It is true, <hi>RONTO</hi> is plainly to be read; but the next Letter is very much defaced; but I fanſied it to be another <hi>R,</hi> whcih I marked down in my Book with points: the firſt long ſtroke is entire, and plain; but for the reſt of it, one hath much adoe to make ſome worn-out Marks hang together. As to the <hi>A,</hi> the <hi>L,</hi> and the <hi>C, ordine retrogrado</hi> following, they are plainly to be read. So that, if I were to be its Reſtitutor, I would write it
<q>
                  <p>— DIVO CAESARI AVGVSTO
<lb/>— E CL. ANNIDIUS
<lb/>— L. F. CL. ARRONTO</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I find the Family <hi>Arruntius</hi> in <hi>Gruterus,</hi> in many Inſcriptions; and <hi>O</hi> for <hi>V</hi> might be an eaſie miſtake of the Graver, in ſo remote a Country, if not of the Perſon himſelf: And we know, that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were not every ones Talent in thoſe days. And to conclude, I believe the <hi>Baſis</hi> upon which this Inſcription is, was not made for that Pillar, becauſe they bear no proportion one with another. It has been, in my opinion, a round Altar, being carved about with Wreaths of abundance, ſuſtained by Bull's-heads. The white Pillar (which I judge about ten foot high above it) might have been erected upon it, to ſerve for a Sea-mark by day, as the Lanthorn at <hi>Fanari</hi> doth by night: Indeed, I ſhould think it any thing, rather than a Pillar erected to <hi>Pompey.</hi> The Rock on whch it ſtands, is one of the <hi>Cyaneae,</hi> or <hi>Symplegades</hi> of the Antients; fanſied to float, becauſe ſometimes ſeen together, as they thought, ſeeing them from ſeveral Stations. But ſome of them are placed on the one ſide of the Entrance of the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> and ſome on the other. Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> counted four on the <hi>European</hi> ſide: But the North-wind beginning to riſe, we were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ruturn ſoon after the viewing of the Pillar.</p>
            <p>In our return, about ſix Miles from the Pillar, we ſtopped to ſee a <hi>Greek</hi> Church, upon the higheſt of the Hills on the <hi>Thracian</hi> Shore, called <hi>Mavronides.</hi> It is a place of very great Devotion among the <hi>Greekes,</hi> and payeth no Taxes to the <hi>Grand Signior;</hi> only a few Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for his own eating. The reaſon of which they told us was this: The <hi>Grand Signior</hi> being a hunting at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> and eagerly purſuing his Game this way, loſt his Attendants, and came to this place; where being weary, hot, and dry, he alighted to repoſe and refreſh himſelf;
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:95495:71"/>and demanding Water of the poor <hi>Caloyers,</hi> who knew him, one of them readily brought him ſome Bread and Water, and freſh-gathered Cherries, which are there excellent good: at which he ſeemed very well pleaſed, and told him, That if he would change his Religion, he would promote him to great Honour. But the poor, yet faithful Chriſtian, reſolving not to part with his Faith, would he have given him his Empire; and knowing he could give that proud Tyrant no Anſwer that would pleaſe him, and ſecure his Conſcience void of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, on that Subject, made no Anſwer at all; but fixed his Eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, notwithſtanding all he could ſay to him. At which he greatly wondering, and admiring his Conſtancy, told him, That for this Service, that Place ſhould pay no <hi>Caratch,</hi> only ſome Cherries yearly to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> for his own eating.</p>
            <p>A little before we arrived at <hi>Gallata,</hi> I took notice of a dangerous Rock in the Chanel, lying piked above Water not more than four or five Foot; which muſt needs be very dangerous for thoſe Veſſels, that paſs that way by night.</p>
            <p>One day we croſs'd over the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> to ſee <hi>Scutari,</hi> and in the Paſſage put a ſhore on the <hi>Maiden Tower</hi> as they call a little Sconce, fortified with a few pieces of great Guns, built upon a Rock about the middle of the Chanel, but rather nearer the Shore of <hi>Natolia.</hi> All that it is remarkable for, is, That although it be but a Rock, not much above thirty Yards about, encompaſſed by the Sea at leaſt half a Mile from any Shore, very deep, yet it hath a Fountain of freſh Water; which, as they aſſured us, ariſeth out of the Rock, and was no Ciſtern. I took notice, that the Current of the <hi>Boſphorus</hi> runs very ſwift on each ſide of it.<note place="margin">SCUTARI.</note> From thence <hi>Scutari</hi> is the neareſt Shore; and is ſituate oppoſite to the Haven, between the two Promontories, of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> and <hi>Gallata.</hi> It is now a large City, and is beautified with a Royal Moſque, built, and endowed by the <hi>Sultaneſs-Mother.</hi> It ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be in the ſame place, that <hi>Strabo</hi> puts <hi>Chryſopolis;</hi> but we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved nothing of Antiquity there. We went through the Town, up to the top of the Hill South-ward, and paſſed through a very large Burying-place of the <hi>Turks,</hi> containing, I believe, above ten or a dozen Acres; which is ordinary in <hi>Turkey,</hi> becauſe they bury not in the place where another hath been buried. They therefore ſet a Stone upright, one at the Head, and another at the Feet of each Body.</p>
            <p>Proceeding a little further on the Brow of the Hill, we had a good Proſpect towards <hi>Conſtantinople, Gallata,</hi> the <hi>Propontis,</hi> and the <hi>Boſphorus:</hi> And here the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> hath a Houſe of Pleaſure, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as they do others, <hi>Serai,</hi> or as the Francks form it, <hi>Seraglio.</hi> They told us, That it was built after the <hi>Perſian</hi> made by the Father, to this <hi>Grand Signior.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hard by this we took Water,<note place="margin">CHALCEDON</note> and paſſed a little reach, about a a Mile and half, to <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> now but a blind Town; as its Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, for their ill Choice, were eſteemed by the Oracle. It is more antient than <hi>Byzantium;</hi> but now famous for nothing, but the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the Great Council held there, in the Year of our Lord 327. and 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the Reign of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great. The firſt thing we did, was to viſit the Metropolitan Church, where they ſay it was kept.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:95495:71"/>But Monſieur <hi>Nanteul</hi> aſſured us, That it was a Mile from thence; and that he had there read an Inſcription, that mentioneth it. Beſide, that it is but a ſmall, obſcure Building, uncapable to contain ſuch an Aſſembly. The <hi>Turks</hi> call it <hi>Cadiqui;</hi> but the <hi>Greeks</hi> yet <hi>Chalcedona.</hi> Here we found ſome antient Sepulchral Monuments, and upon one an Inſcription. We found another Inſcription in the Wall of a private Houſe, near the Church; which ſignifieth, That <hi>Evante,</hi> Son of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pater,</hi> having made a proſperous Voyage towards the <hi>Abrotanians,</hi> and the Iſlands <hi>Cyaneae,</hi> at the Mouth of the <hi>Euxin</hi> Sea, as I before noted; and hence deſiring to return by the <hi>Aegean</hi> Sea, and <hi>Pontus,</hi> offered Cakes at this Statue, which he had erected to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who had ſent him ſuch good Weather, as a Token of his good Voyage.</p>

            <p>WHEN we had ſatisfied our Curioſity with <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> and the Places adjacent, we began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how we might now return to viſit <hi>Athens,</hi> as we deſign'd: But we found all the ways we had propoſed to our ſelves, ſo embarraſſed with great Difficulties, and evident Dangers, that it was no eaſie matter for us to determin which of them to take. Our firſt Determination was, to go from hence to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> to ſee the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Court; ſo to Mount <hi>Athos,</hi> now called <hi>Monte Santo,</hi> which I had a particular deſire to ſee; and thence, through <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Boeotia,</hi> to <hi>Athens.</hi> But my Lord Ambaſſadour, who was then newly return'd from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drianople,</hi> diſſwaded us from that; aſſuring us, That without a Miracle, it was not poſſible to eſcape the Plague; all <hi>Thrace</hi> being ſo through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:95495:73"/>infected with it, that although he himſelf lay in no Houſe or <hi>Kan,</hi> in his Journey thence, yet had loſt one of his Servants by the way; and was forced, ſoon after his Arrival hither, to quit his houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe another fell ſick of it: So that, we thought it would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in us, to adventure our ſelves that way, and no leſs madneſs to hazard our ſelves at Sea, now Winter was coming on, in ſuch ſmall Barques; as we muſt have done, if as we had deſign'd, we had gone but to Mount <hi>Athos,</hi> to ſee how thoſe Hermites ſpend their time there. But whil'ſt we were in theſe doubts, it happened, that ſome of our Engliſh Merchants, that came from <hi>Smyrna</hi> to wait on the Ambaſſadour at his Audience, were ready to return again thither. So that we ſuddenly reſolved to take the Opportunity of their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſee thoſe Parts of <hi>Aſia;</hi> not doubting, but from thence we might meet with an Opportunity according to our deſire, to paſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Greece.</hi> And ſo in the good Company of Doctor <hi>Pickering,</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician to the Factory at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> Dr. <hi>Covel,</hi> who was ſo kind as to bring us ſome part of the way, and divers Merchants; we made a common Purſe, taking a Barque among us, and parted hence about Noon, <hi>October</hi> the Sixth.</p>
            <p>The firſt Village we paſſed by after <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> was <hi>Phanari,</hi> juſt without the <hi>Aſian</hi> Promontory of the <hi>Propontis,</hi> as the other is of the <hi>Euxin</hi> Sea; and hath a Rock lying before it, on which is placed a Pedeſtal of a Pillar, like that of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Pillar: which ſhews them both to have been ſet there only for a Sea-Mark. A little further, without the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> ſteering South-Eaſt-wards, we left at the right hand the Iſland <hi>Prote;</hi> where the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ships, we came in, lay, not daring to venture into the Harbour of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> by reaſon of the Plague. A little further we left another little Iſland, called <hi>Antigoni;</hi> and not far thence another, eſteemed about eighteen Miles from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
               <note place="margin">CHALCIS Inſ.</note> called <hi>Chalcis,</hi> where we lodged that Night. Dr. <hi>Covel,</hi> and I, as ſoon as we ſet footing on the Iſland, went on the top of the higheſt Hill, to view the others round about it, and to ſee if we could find any marks of the Gold Mines they pretend to be there; but inſtead of them, found only Rocks cover'd with <hi>Stoecas Arabica, Myrtles, Arbutus,</hi> and <hi>Ciſtus Foemina, Leidon.</hi> The Iſlands that are about it, are theſe, <hi>Prote</hi> and <hi>Antigoni</hi> North, <hi>Oxya</hi> and <hi>Plate</hi> North-Weſt, called ſo by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> becauſe the one is <hi>pointed,</hi> the other <hi>low</hi> and <hi>plain.</hi> South of it, are two other little Iſlands; the one called <hi>Principe,</hi> which is the biggeſt; and another little one by it, called <hi>Epiti,</hi> in times paſt <hi>Pitys.</hi> Theſe Iſlands lie at the Mouth of a Bay, called formerly <hi>Aſtacenus Sinus,</hi> now <hi>Iſhmit,</hi> from a Town, at the bottom of it, bearing now the ſame name, but was called antiently <hi>Nicomedia.</hi> There is a Village, and two Convents in <hi>Chalcis.</hi> At that on the Weſtern-ſide of the Iſland we lay, and were well treated by the <hi>Caloyers.</hi> This Convent being ruined, was rebuilt by one <hi>Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giotes,</hi> not long ſince <hi>Druggerman</hi> to the <hi>Grand Signior;</hi> and ſo much in his favour, that he obtained many Kindneſſes for his Fellow-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church; as the repairing ſeveral of their Churches and Monaſteries, eſpecially the keeping of the Holy Sepulcher at <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi> But this he kept ſecret until he came to die, becauſe, as ſome
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:95495:73"/>think, he feared the ill Practices of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; who have two Convents at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> one of <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and another of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcans,</hi> lying at lurch to diſable that Church, and would never have patiently ſuffered ſo great a loſs. He lieth buried here, and hath a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument with an Epitaph, expreſſing his Office.</p>
            <p>Here is alſo the Tomb of Sir <hi>Edward Barton,</hi> Ambaſſadour to this Court in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> days.</p>
            <p>The next Morning early we parted thence, and leaving the Iſlands <hi>Epite</hi> and <hi>Principe</hi> on the left hand, we arrived at the other Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Gulf of <hi>Iſhmit;</hi> which by <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> ſeemeth to have been called <hi>Poſidium Promontorium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Parting thence after Dinner,<note place="margin">CIANUS SI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NUS. BESBICUS OR ISOLA DEL PAPA. TRICHLIA.</note> we paſſed with a ſide Wind another Bay, called in times paſt <hi>Cianus Sinus,</hi> of the Name of the City <hi>Cium;</hi> leaving at our right hand, about half way, but without this Bay, the Iſland <hi>Besbicus,</hi> now called the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Iſland,</hi> we came to Shore near <hi>Trich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> ſituate on an Hill. Thence, rowing along the Shore, a Mile fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eaſt-wards, we paſſed by a large Village, called not <hi>Sequino,</hi> as our Map-makers have it, but <hi>Syky,</hi>
               <note place="margin">SYKY.</note> from the abundance of wild Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees that grow there, as the word imports. There is a Church they call <hi>Hagios Strategos,</hi> which is the Name they ordinarily give S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> the Arch-Angel; which is to ſay, the <hi>Holy Captain.</hi> By it, on the Shore, is a Fountain they call <hi>Chriſtos;</hi> the Water of which, they ſay, worketh Miracles; and therefore they name it <hi>Hagiaſma,</hi> or <hi>Holy Water.</hi> We rowed about four or five Miles further, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in the Evening at <hi>Mountania.</hi> This is a large Town,<note place="margin">MOUNTA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIA.</note> and hath a very good <hi>Kan,</hi> two Stories high, ſeparated into little Rooms for better Accommodation. Here we lodged, and were invited to drink Coffee by a <hi>Franck Renegado,</hi> who ſhewed us a moſt obſcene Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet-Show, in which he told us, He pleaſed himſelf at idle times, as an innocent Diverſion: For he pretended to practiſe Phyſick. This hath been an antient and large City, by the Fragments of Antiquity eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where to be ſeen: But what its Name was formerly I know not, unleſs <hi>Cium,</hi> that gave the Gulph this Name; which was after cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Pruſia,</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Hence in the Morning, having hired Horſes at four Timins apiece, we proceeded to <hi>Pruſia,</hi> or as ſome pronounce it, <hi>Burſia.</hi> Juſt out of <hi>Mountania,</hi> we aſcended up a Hill; which, if this Town were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <hi>Cium,</hi> muſt have been called <hi>Argenthonius;</hi> where they cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the Games of <hi>Hyla,</hi> in Honour of <hi>Hylas, Hercules</hi> his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in his Voyage from <hi>Argos</hi> to <hi>Colchus.</hi> Hence we rode about four hours through a fruitful <hi>Plain,</hi> tilled by ſome poor Villages ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered here and there, whoſe Inhabitants owe more Caratch than they are worth; one whereof we paſſed through about half way, called <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanpoula,</hi> and came by Noon to <hi>Prouſa, ad Olympum Myſiae:</hi> For it is ſituated at the Foot of this Mount <hi>Olympus</hi> of <hi>Myſia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">MED. 23.</note> upon a ſmall Hill a little ſeparated from it. Here <hi>Ajax</hi> killed himſelf, when he fled from <hi>Troy:</hi> and therefore they expreſſed it in their Money; of which I have a piece, bearing on the one ſide the Head of the Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> and on the other a Figure falling upon his Sword, at the Foot of a Mountain, with theſe Letters about it,
ΠΡΟΥϹΑΕΩΝ,
of the <hi>Prouſians.</hi> This City hath one of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanteſt Comings to it imaginable; the Country on this ſide of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a large Plain near the City, ſhaded with Mulberry, Walnut, and Cheſnut-Trees, planted with Gardens on each ſide of the high way; which is plain, and with an eaſie Aſcent bringeth you to the City. Beyond it, the Mountain riſeth to a vaſt height, made green with Cheſnut and Firr-Trees, almoſt to the top, which is ſtill cover'd with Snow. This is a City, fair, large, and populous in <hi>Turks, Jews, Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> and <hi>Greeks;</hi> and was the Chief of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, before <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was taken from the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the Eighth of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:95495:74"/>that Name, and laſt <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour. But <hi>Pruſia</hi> parted with its Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Liberty to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Tyranny with more difficulty, having, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was rendred, above a Hundred thouſand Chriſtians ſlain by thoſe Infidels, and abundance more in cold Blood afterwards. For which reaſon they pay alſo double the Caratch, that any other Place doth; and are not ſuffer'd to inhabit within the Walls, but only in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs; which nevertheleſs they bear with Patience, eſteeming it a Mark of their Courage. The Place is eſteem'd to contain now about For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand <hi>Turks,</hi> Twelve thouſand <hi>Jews;</hi> but not ſo many <hi>Greeks,</hi> nor <hi>Armenians.</hi> But <hi>Philadar,</hi> a Town four or five Miles from <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> conſiſts of only Chriſtians. The Conquerour, <hi>Orchanes,</hi> did not think fit to diſmantle the Town, becauſe he made it his principal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence; ſo that the Walls are yet ſtanding, which ſeem to have been built by the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperours, out of the Ruins of ſome former City, as the Marble-Architraves, broken Pillars and Corniſhes, mixed with the other Matter that compoſeth them, do teſtifie. Some Inſcriptions alſo we ſaw, and copied, as we walked the Rounds of them; which they eſteem about ſix Miles.</p>
            <p>Not quite in the middle, but rather more to the South-Eaſt-ſide of the Town, is a high Rock, which was the Caſtle, and is naturally ſtrong; but its old Walls, wherewith it was fortified in Times paſt, are much ruined. It was worth our pains to go up to it, becauſe thence we had the Proſpect of the whole Town, and told above thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Moſques by the Minorets. The Sultans have built ſix or ſeven Royal Moſques here; whereof that of <hi>Adalin</hi> is moſt beautiful. The Form ſquare; and my Companion ſaith, he told Twenty five Cuppa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes of equal bigneſs, covered with Lead for its Roof.</p>
            <p>In this Caſtle are two <hi>Soraglio's,</hi> one old, and the other new. The old is almoſt demoliſhed, and only ſerves to cleanſe Corn, and to make fine Flour for the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> The other was built in two Months time, about ſeventeen Years ago, for the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s coming thither. It is but a ſmall Building; but well contrived with Baths and Stoves, and adorned with Roofs and Walls gilded and painted in pretty Knots and Flowers; with Preſſes on one ſide of each Room for Bedding and Furniture, according to the manner of the <hi>Turks;</hi> who have not their Houſes incumbred with great Bed-ſteads, Tables, Chairs, and Stools: but only a part of the Room raiſed higher than the reſt, and covered with a Carpet; where all get up, and ſit croſs-legg'd, ſometimes with Cuſhions to ſit or lean upon; and this ſerves for Parlour, Dining-Room, and Bed-Chamber. When they ſit to eat, one bringeth a little round Table, ſometimes of one piece of Wood, and ſometimes doubled together, with a low Foot; whereon the Meat is ſet in little Diſhes. One Napkin is long enough for the whole Company, and goeth round the Table; which is ſeldom cover'd with a Cloth, becauſe it ſerveth inſtead of Trenchers. When they go to bed, a Servant cometh, and taketh the Quilts, Sheets, and Coverings, and prepareth for as many as lie there, each one one. It would make but a poor Palace for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Chriſtian Princes. But the Proſpect from the Caſtle is more pleaſant, being ſituate upon the Brow of the Hill, overlooking the Town and Country: which was no more than neceſſary; for it hath
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:95495:75"/>no other Garden now. We expected a better Shew for our <hi>Doller</hi> a Head; which the Keeper exacted of us. But it is good to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceived of the high Opinions we have of Things, which deſerve them not; eſpecially when our <hi>Experience</hi> coſts not too dear.</p>
            <p>There is no conſiderable River near this Town. But the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain doth furniſh them with ſo many Springs, that I never ſaw more Fountains, nor with greater Sources of Water in any place where-ever I have been: but they are not eſteemed very wholſome; I believe, becauſe the Snow-Water continually melting from the Mountain, mixeth with them. Theſe, with what falls from the Mountain, make two little Streams; one whereof we paſſed, coming into the Town; and the other I paſſed over by a Bridge, on the North-Eaſt-ſide of the Town, to go up the Mountain; which hath another Bridge, not far from this: both well-built and large, joyning the Suburbs to the Town.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Metropolitan</hi> Church is well worth ſeeing, having been a fair Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, caſed within with curious, and well-wrought Marble, built in the form of a <hi>Greek</hi> Croſs that is ſquare, with a Cuppalo in the Middle, held up by four Pillars; which being beat down in the time of the Siege, was repaired by the <hi>Turks;</hi> and the fair Capitals of the Pillars ſet, where the Baſis ſhould be; and the Baſis, where the Capitals: An Emblem of their Tyranny over Chriſtendom, turning all things upſide down. So have they made this Holy Place the Sepulcher of <hi>Orchanes,</hi> the Conquerour of it, and the Second King of the <hi>Turks.</hi> But there yet remains the Place of the Altar, which they call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or the <hi>Holy Aſcent;</hi> being according to their Cuſtom, a place containing three Seats one above another, in form of a Semi-circle: On the firſt the Patriarch and Metropolitans uſe to ſit, on the next the Biſhops, and on the other the Presbyters, when the Sacrament was celebrated. Adjoyning to this, is the Sepulcher of <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>Beyond the Stream, on the North-Eaſt-ſide of the Town, is a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Moſque, and a Colledge by it, with twelve Apartments for twelve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ers; who are obliged to teach to Write, Read, and the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Law. Thither any poor Man may come, and eat at any time; and on <hi>Fridays,</hi> be feaſted with Rice. Hard by is the Founder's Sepulcher, which looketh very prettily; being a large Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palo, covered with Lead on the top, and the Walls caſed with <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celane</hi> Tiles.</p>
            <p>Here are three or four very good <hi>Kans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">KANS.</note> built two Stories high, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Lead, each Room a Cuppalo over it. For this Town is a great Thorow-fare, and of much Traffick; all the <hi>Caravans</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Smyrna, Aleppo,</hi> and moſt part of thoſe from <hi>Perſia</hi> to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> paſſing by this Place. The <hi>Baſars</hi> are well built, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Merchants, and all ſorts of Merchandizes: A great deal of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth is brought hither, and no ſmall quantity of Silk made here; the Plains being covered with Mulberry-Trees, to feed the Silk-Worms.</p>
            <p>Here many of the <hi>Turks</hi> ſeem to live more gentilely than ordinary, and have their Houſes of Pleaſure without the Town. One I ſaw
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:95495:75"/>belonging to a <hi>Haga,</hi> well contrived with ſhady Walks, Chioſques, Fountains, and Artificial Fiſh-Ponds. Here Dr. <hi>Covel</hi> made me take notice of a Willow-Tree, whoſe large Branches were ſo limber, that they bend down to the Ground, from a good high-pollard Trunk, and naturally make a curious ſhady Bower about it. The Leaf is like our Oſiers. There is plenty of all ſorts of Proviſions here, and moſt delicious Fruits; eſpecially Pomegranates, which are eſteemed ſo good, that they are ſent from thence to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> for the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s eating. Great plenty of excellent Freſh-Water-Fiſh; which the Lake on the Mountain, and others not far off, with the River <hi>Aſcanius,</hi> not a days Journey thence, furniſheth them with: Eſpecially Carps, Trouts, and Eeles. Of the firſt I ſaw many, and eat of ſome three Foot in length, with their large Bellies filled with fat. Of the laſt we were made a Preſent of one, by an <hi>Armenian</hi> that had been in <hi>England,</hi> above an Ell long, large, and white as Silver. This <hi>Armenian</hi> inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, That the Mountain was almoſt covered with curious Plants; which made Dr. <hi>Covel,</hi> who is a great Lover of them, as well as my ſelf, long to go and ranſack it; which the ſtay we made being long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than we thought, by reaſon that Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> fell ſick here, gave us opportunity to do. So that, <hi>Monday</hi> the Eleventh of <hi>October,</hi> about five a Clock in the Morning, having hired Horſes for two Dollars, five Timins to our Janizary, and as much to our Guide; ſetting out, and beginning to mount <hi>Olympus,</hi> we came up to the higheſt part we could for the Snow, about Eleven a Clock. Whence from a pointed Hill, on the North-ſide, we had a moſt Charming Proſpect: the height making it from North to South unbounded, the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern half of the Compaſs; from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> all the <hi>Propontis,</hi> the Plains of <hi>Myſia</hi> to Mount <hi>Ida,</hi> with the Lake and River <hi>Aſcanius,</hi> lay plain before us as in a Map: But more particularly thus.</p>
            <p>The two Bays we paſſed by over the <hi>Propontis,</hi> lay parallel to each other North; that of <hi>Iſhmit</hi> ſtretching it ſelf fartheſt Eaſt; this of <hi>Mountania</hi> having one Lake on the Eaſt end, which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe emptieth it ſelf into the <hi>Propontis</hi> by it; and another in a Valley, near to the Foot of this Mountain. North-Weſt by North, the Iſland <hi>Chalcis,</hi> &amp;c. and a little more Weſt-ward, <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> as they ſay, an hundred Miles diſtant: but I cannot judge it quite ſo much. Juſt againſt the Mouth of the Bay of <hi>Mountania,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Iſland, as ſome of the Country now call it, and in old time <hi>Besbicus.</hi> Weſt we had the Plain of <hi>Prouſa,</hi> ſtrewed with Villages, and here and there a conſiderable Town: South-Weſt, the River <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canius,</hi> with the Lake full of little Iſlands. There is a Plain on the top of the Monntain, ſurrounded with little Hills, pointed with Rocks; from whence many Springs ariſe, and collect themſelves into a pretty Stream, full of little Trouts; ſome of which our Guide caught with his hands. But the greateſt part of the Stream cometh from a large Lake Eaſt-ward; which we could not come to, becauſe the way was covered with Snow: From whence the large Carps, and Eeles, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, are caught; and Trouts of ſuch Fame, that they have gotten the good Name of all other Fiſh in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:95495:76"/>who call them <hi>Alagballuck,</hi> the <hi>Good Fiſh:</hi> And therefore the beſt of them uſed to be carried to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> as a moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate diſh.</p>
            <p>It is now time to tell you what luck we had a ſimpling, the chief end of our mounting ſo high: For after we had taken this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and baited our ſelves, I left Dr. <hi>Covel</hi> deſigning the Trout: So ranging from top to top of the Mountain, I gathered all the new things I met with, and in two hours time returned with more curious Plants, than I could ever ſince find Names for: But ſuch as I have found, are as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Towards the Foot of the Mountain, aſcending the firſt Mile or two, are abundance of Cheſnut-Trees, that bear the largeſt and beſt Nuts I ever ſaw or taſted; with other ſorts of ordinary Trees.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Something higher I obſerved many Lime-Trees, and towards the top, and on the top, Groves of a ſort of Firr-Trees, which Dr. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel</hi> and I took for Cedar-Trees, becauſe they bear the Cones upwards, not hanging downwards, as the other Firr-Trees do; and the ſame ſhape with the Cedar, <hi>viz.</hi> thick and ſhort like an Egg, and of a brown reddiſh colour, and the Smell of the Cones and Gum very O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doriferous. The Leaves alſo are not ſhaped like others; but thicker, duller pointed, and have two Stripes of white on the back-ſide, like <hi>Oxyjuniper.</hi> It beareth the Branches round the Body orderly, from the bottom to the top, at ſeveral diſtances, leſs and leſs unto the top; where the Cones grow upon the young Branches upright. I cannot tell whether it be not the <hi>Male-Pine;</hi> for this <hi>Caſpar Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinus,</hi> in his <hi>Pinax,</hi> calleth the <hi>Male</hi> alſo. <hi>Abies, conis ſurſum ſpectan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus, ſive mas.</hi> It agreeth alſo with <hi>Gerard</hi>'s Deſcription of the ſame, excepting that the Body is ſmooth, without Knots at the bottom: For the Branches of this begin very near the Ground, and ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad very large; and that he ſaith, The Cones are longer than any of the Coniferous Plants; whereas this (as I before ſaid) hath the Cone thick, and ſhorter than any other in proportion. It agreeth very well with the Deſcription he giveth of the Cedar of Mount <hi>Libanus;</hi> but I doubt, it wanteth the hardneſs: for I ſaw many rotten Trees of this; but, if I remember right, of ſomewhat a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh colour. And alſo Mr. <hi>Gerard</hi> faileth, in that he ſaith, The Leaves of that of <hi>Libanus</hi> are ſhorter, and not ſo ſharp pointed; whereas many of thoſe Branches, that I have ſeen, have the Leaves much ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter indeed, but more ſharp pointed than this.</p>
            <p>To conclude, This Tree groweth in great plenty upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Greece</hi> alſo; as <hi>Citheron</hi> and <hi>Helicon;</hi> and <hi>Parnaſſus:</hi> which Monſieur <hi>Nanteul</hi> obſerving, who had been upon Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> and theſe alſo, affirmed, That they were the very ſame. But although he is a very curious and ingenious Man, yet I doubt his Curioſity doth not conſiſt in narrowly diſtinguiſhing Plants. Therefore this muſt be either another kind of Firr, or <hi>Gerard</hi> hath failed in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:95495:76"/>of it. I am rather induced to think it is a kind Firr, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Greeks</hi> yet call this Tree <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="3">3. A kind of <hi>Cyſtus,</hi> which groweth to a good large Shrub, of a hard, woody Subſtance, covered with a Bark, conſiſting of ſeveral thin Skins, which eaſily ſeparate one from another: The firſt is of a brown Aſh-colour; the next reddiſh, out of which come Branches, dividing themſelves by pairs, each Twig ending in a bunch of Leaves; which ſtand in pairs, each pair croſſing each other; and at the Stem of the old Leafs iſſue new Buds, very much like Sage: but the Leaves are in ſhape, ribbed with three Ribs, like <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Laurel, of a dark green colour, and of a ſweet ſmell, thick and gummy. On the top are Knots of Seeds, divided into Three. The Flowers I ſaw not. It agreeth much with the Deſcription, and Deſign Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> hath given to <hi>Gerard</hi>'s Hiſtory of Plants, <hi>viz.</hi> page 1289. in the <hi>Ciſtus Ledum Matheoli.</hi> Mr. <hi>Merchant</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> called it, when I ſhewed it him, <hi>Cistus Laurinis folijs;</hi> but had never before ſeen it.</p>

Another Plant I found here, which muſt be numbred among the <hi>Hypericons;</hi> although I find it no where deſcribed, or ſo that I knew it by their Deſcription; and is a Plant I never ſaw any where, but upon this Mountain: From a ſtringy Root, ſpringeth at firſt a thick Tuft of tender Sprouts, whoſe Leaves are ſet ſo thick after one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, two by two, and croſſing each other, that they quite hide the round Stalk, and make it look moſt Beautiful. It ſeemeth all over hairy; but as it groweth up about half a foot high, it ſtretcheth the Leaves to a greater diſtance from each other, in pairs, and ſtill croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing each other.

They ſay, when it is blown, there is a Duſt that may be ſhaken off this Plant, which is the beſt Powder.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Armenian</hi> told us, There groweth a World of other curious Plants, and fair Flowers, about this Mountain; but that the time of Year to ſee them, was paſt. As for me, I was glad I found theſe, and ſorry that Night grew ſo near, that I was forced to deſiſt ſearching them, to find the way down; which we did with difficulty enough, not being half way down before the Night over-took us; nor ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived we to the <hi>Kan,</hi> before ten or eleven at Night.</p>
            <p>I was carried to a <hi>Turkiſh Quack-Salver,</hi> a Man reputed for his Skill in Phyſick among them; where I ſaw a great many ordinary Herbs, dried in bundles: ſome I knew not; perhaps it was becauſe ill dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

It being Afternoon, the time when the Women bathe only, the Men in the Forenoon, we could not enter into the Chiefeſt. Only into one, built by the Piety of a potent Man of the Country, with Lodgings to it, commodious for the uſe of Strangers: The <hi>Baſin</hi> of which is not great, but of Marble, and covered with a Cuppalo, with Bell-Glaſſes here and there, to let in the Light, but not the Air. The Doctor and I concluded, That the Water here is much hotter than ours in <hi>England;</hi> it not being poſſible to be endured, without tempering it with cold Water.</p>
            <p>I was ſurprized the next Morning, when I came to get on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, that I had no Bridle: For, not knowing their Cuſtom, I had forgot to put it into my Bargain; which was three Dollars a Horſe to <hi>Smyrna.</hi> But I made our Guide to get me one, before I would part thence. But, as my Companion obſerveth, I learned afterwards in <hi>Greece</hi> to be leſs nice: For there we were ſometimes mounted like <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> in the Capitol, without Bridle or Saddle. However, we parted before it was day; and having rid through a plain South-weſt from this place, part being well tilled, and part Paſture; ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Cows, Horſes, and Boufalos; a ſort of Cattle not much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from Oxen; only they love the Water better, and are much worſe Meat; but labour extreamly well. We ſtaid to bait our ſelves at a little <hi>Greek</hi> Village; but not our Horſes: for they are accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to travel all day without it, in <hi>Turkey.</hi> After Dinner we proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtill through a Country, much of the ſame Nature with that in the Morning; only here and there ſome little Hills, that gave us good Proſpects of the other parts of the ſpacious Campagne. This day we met with half a dozen of Horſe-men, which we took to be Robbers; and not without reaſon, as we were afterwards informed.

               <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardiſton</hi>'s Men, we were ſeven of us well armed, beſides our Guides: So that we were not afraid of a greater force than theirs. An hour and an half, or two Hours, we went along, not far diſtant at our left hand, a fine Lake, as we judg'd it, about twenty five Miles long, and about ſeven or eight broad; through which the River <hi>Aſcanius</hi> runneth, as we then judged, and the Lake it ſelf, to have been ſo called alſo; but I rather believe it to be the <hi>Rhyndicus.</hi>

The Walls were undoubtedly built by the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperours, and yet are ſtanding in a ſquare Figure, with Baſtions every fifteen or twenty paces; one Hexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, and the other Triangular: But the South-wall Baſtions are all Triangular, or Cone-faſhion; I ſuppoſe, againſt the Inundations of the River. Whether <hi>Ferrari</hi> calleth it rightly <hi>Apollonia,</hi> I do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin: But I am ſure, they place this Lake too near the <hi>Propontis;</hi> and this City alſo on the wrong ſide of the Lake; and indeed are wrong, in placing it at all upon the Lake: For it is upon the River, about three or four Miles after it cometh out of the Lake, and about five or ſix and thirty Miles from <hi>Prouſa ad Olympum.</hi>

He had at leaſt a dozen of Servants, and Friends, that waited upon, and accompanied him. But he ſeemed to be better prepared to hunt Hares and Partridges, than to catch Thieves: For he had two brace of Grey-hounds with him, and a Hawk. He joyned very civilly with us, and after ſome diſcourſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited us to take part of his Sport: which we did, he ſtill hunting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long our way, in the Corn-fields. We had good ſport both in Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and Hawking: We chaced three Hares, and killed one; and had a flight after a Partridge, but without ſucceſs. After this he invited us to Dinner with him; which our Doctor and Merchant excuſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing jealous of <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Kindneſs. Here I firſt took notice, That the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Grey-hounds differ from ours, having their Heads and Ears like a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel; but otherwiſe well made to run.</p>
            <p>After we had baited, we purſued our way over ſeveral Plains and Hills, which often afforded us a moſt delightful Proſpect of Mount <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympus,</hi> that had now contracted it ſelf into a much leſs compaſs, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to our view: Yet its hoary Head ſhewed it ſelf more lofty at that diſtance; being before hid from our ſight by its broad Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Here we paſſed over a little River, running into the <hi>Granicus;</hi> and towards the Evening, came to the Banks of the <hi>Granicus</hi> it ſelf: which was the firſt Theater of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s great Glory. For here he overcame <hi>Darius</hi> his Governours, and with them all <hi>Aſia</hi> within <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> unto the River <hi>Euphrates.</hi> We went ſometime along the Banks; and about two Hours before Night, we paſſed it over a Wooden Bridge, ſuſtained by Piles of Stone; which, perhaps, were formerly to hold up the Stone Arches of it. From a little Hill in the way, we ſaw a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:95495:80"/>Weſt of <hi>Mountania;</hi> where the River <hi>Granicus,</hi> joyned to that they call the <hi>Aſcanius,</hi> emptieth it ſelf into the Sea; which together, muſt needs b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a great River; but now not Navigable, by reaſon of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Sloth, which letteth it be choaked up with Mud.</p>
            <p>This day I obſerved in the Fields a kind of <hi>Abrotanum,</hi> an Annual Plant, whoſe Seeds are very pleaſant to the Taſte; and alſo another <hi>Perennial.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Melilote,</hi> with white Flowers, growing above a Man's height; it is a <hi>Perennial</hi> Plant, almoſt of a ſhrubby Subſtance. For the Flowers of the Summer being paſt, it now had new ones, or new Sprouts out of the ſame Stalk. There grow wild alſo abundance of <hi>Plane-Trees,</hi> along the River; which after we had paſſed, we came to our <hi>Conack,</hi> about a Mile or two further, at a Village on the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, called <hi>Suſugerli;</hi>
               <note place="margin">SUSUGERLI.</note> that is as much as to ſay, the place of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falo's.</hi> Here is a good <hi>Kan,</hi> but we lay not at it; but at a <hi>Turk</hi>'s Houſe, as bad: For We and our Horſes were treated in the ſame Room; the difference was only, that we were ſet up a little higher, on a <hi>Sofa,</hi> on one ſide of the Room; and they on the other ſide, on the Ground. Our Supper was <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Paſties, that were made of Meat minced fine, Marrow, Bread crummed, and Sugar; baked between two Leaves of Paſte in Tin-pans. The next Diſh was <hi>Dulma;</hi> which is a Compound of Meat, Suet, Onyons, and Spice, made up like Sauſage-Meat wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in Cabbage, or Vine-Leaves, and are either boiled or fried; and then ſerved with a little Vinegar on them, and are both very good. The third was a chief Diſh among the <hi>Turks,</hi> like to <hi>Pilau,</hi> which is ordinarily made of Rice; but this was Wheat, or Barley, peeled, and boil'd with a Hen, or other Meat. They call it <hi>Tragana.</hi> Afterwards we had a Banquet of Sweet-Meats, made of boiled Wine.</p>
            <p>The next Morning we parted early, and paſſed ſtill along the <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus;</hi> where I remarked growing abundance of <hi>Aſphodelus junci folio.</hi> Six or ſeven Miles further, over the Water, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Pickering</hi> made us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve at a diſtance the Ruins of a Caſtle; which is thought to have been built by <hi>Alexander,</hi> when he paſſed this River. This Country beareth little, beſides Corn and Paſture, becauſe only inhabited by <hi>Turks:</hi> no Vineyards, nor Wine to be had.</p>
            <p>About Mid-way we came to paſs between two Ridges of a Mountain; where ſtandeth an old <hi>Kan,</hi> called the <hi>Iron Gate,</hi> from the Gate of the <hi>Kan,</hi> which was ſuch. The antient Name was <hi>M. Timnus,</hi> as near as I can gueſs by <hi>Ptolomy.</hi> This is a noted place for Robbers; which made us keep cloſe together, and ſtand to our Arms. And not above two or three Miles thence, when we lighted to bait by a Fountain in the Fields, by the way we found the Skull of a Man; who in all likelihood had been murdered, travelling the Road.</p>
            <p>This Morning we over-took, and paſſed by ſeveral great <hi>Caravans,</hi> of Camels and Dromedaries; each Drove of which had an Aſs, or Mule, to lead the way; all bound for <hi>Smyrna.</hi> We made our <hi>Conack,</hi> or days Journey, by three or four of the Clock in the Afternoon, arriving at a Village called <hi>Mandragorai;</hi> a pitiful place, conſiſting only of a few Hutts, built of Earth, baked in the Sun. We lodged in the <hi>Kan;</hi> which was no better than a large Barn, with a <hi>Sopha</hi> or Bank round the Wall of it within, raiſed from the Ground about a foot and half,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:95495:80"/>or two foot high, eight foot broad; and at every eight, or ten foot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, a little Chimney; between which Spaces they lie: the <hi>Kan</hi>-keeper bringing only Ruſh-Matts, on which we laid our Quilts we brought with us. In the Chimney we might dreſs our Meat our ſelves, or chuſe to faſt. Our Horſes were tied at our Beds-feet to Poſts; and upon ſo much of the <hi>Sopha,</hi> as the Bed does not take up, are fed with chopped Straw and Barley. For they feed their Horſes here with neither Hay nor Oats, but Straw; which maketh them lightſome, and never purſey. This <hi>Kan</hi> is held up in the middle by Marble Pillars, ſet confuſedly on their <hi>Corinthian</hi> Capitals, of very curious Work; which made us believe, that this had been ſome more antient place. My Companion, from the reſemblance of the Name, thinketh, That it might have been the City <hi>Mandropolis,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Pliny</hi> to be in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> where then we were.</p>
            <p>From this <hi>Kan</hi> is a little Walk to a ſmall Stream, which they ſay is the River <hi>Granicus.</hi> But this upon more collect Thoughts, I do not believe; nor that the River we paſſed the day before, and this, are one and the ſame River: For I have noted in my Journal, That we paſſed by the River ſuppoſed the <hi>Granicus,</hi> againſt the Stream; which is impoſſible, if the other be true, having paſſed it the day before run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Weſt-wards. For I remember, that when at laſt we paſſed that ſuppoſed to be the <hi>Granicus,</hi> it was near the Mountains, over which we went; and but a ſmall Stream, ſhaded with <hi>Plane</hi>-Trees, near the <hi>Iron-Gate;</hi> not far from whence, I believed the Spring to riſe. The exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining of which hath made another Errour manifeſt to me; which is, That the Lake and River paſſing by <hi>Lupadi,</hi> is not the <hi>Aſcanius,</hi> as is generally believed; and that the mouths of it, and the <hi>Granicus,</hi> are a vaſt way off one from the other, if any credit may be given to <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy</hi>'s Tables. My Opinion is, firſt, That that Lake before-mentioned, North of <hi>Olympus,</hi> and the River from it, is the true <hi>Aſcanius,</hi> empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf into the <hi>Sinus Cianus</hi> of the <hi>Propontis:</hi> For both <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> make the <hi>Aſcanius</hi> to be in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> as all Geographers place it: only a French-man, one Monſieur <hi>Phide,</hi> will have it in the middle of <hi>Galatia;</hi> which is manifeſtly falſe. Secondly, That River paſſing by <hi>Lupadi,</hi> or <hi>Lubat,</hi> I believe to be the <hi>Rhyndicus;</hi> and thoſe next Streams may probably be thoſe, which collect themſelves to make the <hi>Granicus;</hi> but then they fall not into that River with the Lake, by <hi>Lubat,</hi> if <hi>Ptolomy</hi> is true: but if they do, it is but part of the <hi>Rhyndicus,</hi> and not the <hi>Granicus.</hi> For he giveth the Fountain, and Mouth of that River above a Degrees difference in Longitude and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. But as to the <hi>Granicus,</hi> he giveth no account at all of the Fountain, but only of the Mouth, which he placeth between <hi>Parium</hi> and <hi>Lampſacus,</hi> emptying it ſelf into the <hi>Propontis,</hi> nor yet of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Aeſopus.</hi> Wherefore theſe may be eſteemed ſome other Rivers of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> or <hi>Myſia Minor,</hi> or <hi>Helleſpontick Myſia;</hi> which I ſuppoſe to be extended until the Mountain, by the <hi>Iron-Gate,</hi> or Mount <hi>Timnus,</hi> now mentioned: Whence alſo I believe <hi>Myſia major</hi> begins, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto the Mountain by <hi>Thyatira.</hi> Thirdly, This River at <hi>Mandragorai</hi> abovementioned, is, moſt probably, the <hi>Caicus:</hi> whoſe Fountain <hi>Ptolomy</hi> putteth in the ſame Latitude with the <hi>Rhyndicus,</hi> but not in the ſame
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:95495:81"/>Longitude: and <hi>Strabo</hi> makes the <hi>Caicus</hi> to paſs through the beſt part of <hi>Myſia,</hi> before it comes to <hi>Pergamo.</hi> But this by the way. I was going to tell what Plants I found by it, in my Walk this Evening.</p>

            <p>The next morning we parted thence, and ſoon paſſed the River: Whence up and down in a rough Mountainous Country, we travelled till about three in the Afternoon; when we arrived at a Village un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Mountain, called <hi>Courougouli,</hi> or the <hi>Dry Lake.</hi> For the Plain round about in Winter is filled with Water, like a Lake, and in the Summer is dry.</p>

            <p n="2">2. But the Plant which pleaſed me moſt to ſee here, was a moſt beautiful kind of <hi>Origanum,</hi> with long purple Flowers. Mr. <hi>Merchant</hi>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:95495:81"/>calleth it <hi>Origanum Heracleoticum, Flore purpureo:</hi> But Dr. <hi>Moriſon</hi> much better hath named it <hi>Origanum ſpicatum.</hi> It is an <hi>Origanum</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from any, that hath been ſeen in our parts. From black; ſtringy, and creeping Roots, riſe up many downy, round Stalks, beſet in pairs of Leaves, at firſt ſomewhat downy, and ribbed with ſuch ſmall Ribs, as are hardly perceiveable to the Touch. The Shape is round near the Stem, and endeth in a ſharp point, like the ſmall Myrtle. Theſe ſhoot a foot and half, or two foot high from the Ground; the Stalk and Leaves growing ſmooth; and towards the top, in pairs, it ſendeth out very ſmall Twigs, which end in a ſcaly Flower, like a Hop, ſometimes near an inch long, and of a light purple colour; between whoſe ſcales come ſmall Purple Flowers. When they are bruiſed, they ſend forth a weak Scent, ſomething reſembling <hi>Stoecas Arabicus.</hi> I found it both in Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Seed; with which I have furniſhed ſeveral Gardens: And it flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth now very well, at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day we paſſed over a good high Mountain, whence we had the Proſpect of a large Plain, Eaſt of us; and came very early to <hi>Baſculumbai,</hi> a Village of about two or three hundred Houſes;<note place="margin">BASCULUM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BAI.</note> having a <hi>Kan,</hi> and three <hi>Moſques</hi> alſo. We lodged at an Acquaintance of the Doctor's, a <hi>Turk,</hi> that made as much of us as he could.

Here I obſerved a little River, which may fall into the <hi>Caicus.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> the Nineteenth of <hi>October,</hi> we parted hence early in the morning; and about a Mile from the Town, left the common Road to <hi>Smyrna</hi> on the right hand, and paſſed through a pleaſant Country, mixed with Woods and Paſtures, until we came to a Mountain, ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out in length Eaſt and Weſt; yet not very high. It hath a Gap in the middle, through which we paſſed along a Stream; great part of which is carried in Aqueducts under-ground to <hi>Thyatira.</hi> This Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is ſuppoſed to part <hi>Myſia major</hi> and <hi>Lydia.</hi> To defend this Paſſage, on the right hand, a good height, are the Ruins of an old Caſtle, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Turks <hi>Akeiſar,</hi> or <hi>White Caſtle;</hi> as they do alſo now call <hi>Thyatira;</hi> which we ſaw from hence, over a Plain, about two Miles further South, and arrived thither about Noon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thyatira</hi> is a very antient City in <hi>Lydia,</hi> or in the Confines of <hi>Myſia,</hi> a Colony of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> according to <hi>Strabo</hi> ſituate almoſt in the mid-way between <hi>Pergamo</hi> and <hi>Sardis,</hi> in a very delightful Plain. But ſince more famous in Holy Writ; being one of thoſe Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> the Son of God vouchſafed to write to by the Holy Apoſtle, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:95495:82"/>Town, deſtitute both of Church and Prieſt. Their Patience and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering undoubtedly is great, among that diſproportionable number of Infidels: For the Town is very populous in <hi>Turks,</hi> and may contain four or five thouſand Souls. Its antient Temporal, as well as Spiritual Beauty, is deſtroyed; its Marble Buildings are buried in their own Ruins; Houſes built of Clods of Earth, and dried in the Sun, only remaining; and its once glorious Name obliterated: Inſomuch that a very little while ago, none knew where it was to be found, nor where it did ſtand. Some thought, with the ignorant <hi>Greeks,</hi> that it was <hi>Tyreth,</hi> a Town South-Eaſt of <hi>Epheſus</hi> about twenty Miles: where they pretend, they have the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

            <p>Upon a Pillar in the <hi>Kan,</hi> that the Emperour <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> had here or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their ways to be made the ſixth Year of his Conſulſhip: And out of Conſul <hi>Ricaut</hi>'s Remarks, an Inſcription ſhewed, That the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Severus</hi> was honoured by the very great City of <hi>Thyatira.</hi> Both which made me believe, That they did but flatter the Emperour <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racalla,</hi> in calling him their <hi>Founder,</hi> or <hi>Reſtorer:</hi> Perhaps it was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he granted them ſome Priviledges they before wanted. This Town is well water'd, and hath little Rivulets running in ſeveral Streets. Here are ſeven Moſques; one of them a Chriſtian ſhewed us, and told us, It had been a Chriſtian Church. The point of its <hi>Minoret</hi> is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and the reaſon that they give, is, That it having been a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, God will not ſuffer it to ſtand. For it hath been ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times built, or ſet up; and as often ſuddenly thrown down. On the out-ſide were ſhewed us two Inſcriptions. Here are alſo two <hi>Kans;</hi> in one of which we lodged, being of one ſtory: ſuſtained by thirty Marble Pillars of divers Proportions and Orders; whoſe curious wrought Capitals are now become their <hi>Pedeſtals.</hi> Some of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der were carved with Leaves on the Fuſts, as well as the Capitals, partly chanelled, and partly carved; like thoſe you may ſee in the Front of the Temple at <hi>Milaſſo;</hi> being a kind of Ornament not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. And as to ſuch leaſed Pillars, Mr. <hi>Galante,</hi> Antiquary to the <hi>French</hi> King, gives my Comrade this his Remark. There is a Chioſque, or Pavilion, near <hi>Ingerliqui,</hi> on the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> towards the Black Sea, built by <hi>Sultan Solyman;</hi> the Foundation of which conſiſts of many Pillars: amongſt the reſt one of about a foot and half Diameter; of which is ſeen not above two foot of the end, towards the Baſe, boulting out
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:95495:85"/>of the Foundation, in imitation of Canons, as the reſt do. But this is particularly remarkable, for the carving towards the Baſe with <hi>Vine Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> mixed with Figures of ſeveral ſorts of Creatures, as Beetles and Snails, with two Maſques, and a Veſſel full of Grapes, trodden by three Men: all excellent work. Without doubt, this was taken from the Temple of <hi>Bacchus;</hi> of which <hi>Petrus Gillius</hi> maketh mention in his Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> For ſpeaking of the Pillars, he ſaith thus: <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitula inferiorum Echinos habent circumdantes imam partem; reliqua pars eſt tota veſtita foliis.</hi> But he had not obſerved them very nearly. By a Fountain hard by this <hi>Kan,</hi> I obſerved a <hi>Baſſo-relievo</hi> of Plenty, and a <hi>Pedestal</hi> of a Statue, great part in the ground; which we had not time to dig up, and ſee whether it had an Inſcription upon it: But ſome Figures were on the ſides.</p>
            <p>The other is a leſſer, but a better <hi>Kan,</hi> of two Stories. The Town is well ſerved with ordinary Proviſions. They make a great deal of Cotton here, and ſend it to <hi>Smyrna;</hi> which from hence is but two ſmall days Journeys.</p>
            <p>In our way thither I obſerved among the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Broom, and other Shrubs, that which <hi>Caſp. Bauhinus</hi> calleth <hi>Spartium alterum monoſpermum,</hi> and <hi>Pſeudo-ſpartium, Hiſpanicum Aphyllon; Bastard Spaniſh Broom.</hi>
               <note place="margin">PLANTS AT THYATIRA.</note> Here I ſaw another, in the ploughed Ground, in the Plains, and elſewhere. The Doctor called it <hi>Thapſus minor, longifolio;</hi> and told me, It was the only Remedy the People uſed there in all Diſeaſes. The Leaves are ſomething in ſhape like a <hi>Sage-Leaf;</hi> but thick-cover'd, with a bright ſilver Hair, like Pluſh. The Flowers I ſaw not: but I eſteem it rather to be reduced to the <hi>Sideritis,</hi> than <hi>Thapſus;</hi> or rather a kind of <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chys.</hi> For I think it to be the ſame I gathered at <hi>Tine,</hi> with Stalks and Seeds.</p>
            <p>The next Morning, <hi>October</hi> the twentieth, two hours before day, we left <hi>Thyatira,</hi> guiding our courſe South-Weſt-wards, and had almoſt loſt our way, a little out of the Town, in the dark, and a quaggy wet Ground. But in about two hours time, we foorded a little River, near a Bridge; among the Stones of which one was a Marble, whereon the Name of <hi>Tiberius Caeſar</hi> was engraven; and not a ſtones caſt further, another River, doubtleſs part of the ſame Stream: both running North-wards from thence, I believe, to ſeek the <hi>Caicus</hi> towards <hi>Pergamus.</hi> Thence we paſſed over a Plain, about four or five Miles every way o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and came to a Hill, whence we had the Proſpect of the ſpacious Plains of <hi>Magneſia,</hi> bounded with Mount <hi>Sipylus</hi> South-wards; at the foot of which we diſcerned the City it ſelf, near five hours before we came to it. A very little more to the Eaſt, we ſaw Mount <hi>Pinolus;</hi> by which is <hi>Sardis.</hi> This Plain is counted fifty or ſixty Miles long from Eaſt to Weſt; and near about fifteen broad. It is famous in the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory, by the glorious Victory of <hi>Lucius Scipio</hi> over <hi>Antioohus;</hi>

            </p>
            <p>We baited at a <hi>Turk</hi>'s Country-houſe, ſomething beyond the middle of the Plain; and about two hours after, arrived at <hi>Magneſia,</hi> about three in the Afternoon; after we had paſſed the <hi>Hermus,</hi> a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble River, near a Mile from it; leaving on both ſides of its Chanel, a deep moory Ground; which would be impaſſable, unleſs the way were caſt up, and trenched on each ſide.</p>

This is to be ſeen in many an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Monuments, and Coins; as in one I found at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> in the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian</hi> Church yard, the Sepulchral Monument of one <hi>Tatias,</hi> Son of <hi>Herothemus,</hi>

            <p>The Situation of This and <hi>Prouſa,</hi> look much alike delightful, and reſemble one another: As that lieth under <hi>Olympus;</hi> ſo this under <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pylus,</hi> and ſeem to have ſhared alike in fate; having been its Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor in the Imperial Seat of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire; and remains yet a <hi>Baſhalique,</hi> although of late governed by a Deputy, under the Title of <hi>Moſelim;</hi> and is great, populous, and rich, from the Trade it dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in Cotton. We lodged at the Houſe of the Chief of the Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; who was eminent in the War of <hi>Candia:</hi> for which this was his Reward now, living in great Repute for his Courage; from being a Servant to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Smyrna.</hi> His Houſe is pretty, and he treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us well. He furniſhed us with a Janizary, to ſee the <hi>Seraglio</hi> of the Grand <hi>Signior,</hi> when they abode here, as in their chief Imperial City; which is now well near ruined. The Lodgings have a ſpired Tower, covered with Lead, five ſtories high; and it had a large Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den about it, adorned with Chioſques, Fiſh-ponds, Fountains, and Baths. About the Walls, and Trees, I obſerved abundance of Storks; which were now going all away South-wards, Winter growing on: as we daily obſerved them, in vaſt flights, all the way from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> thither.</p>
            <p>They have a great many Moſques, and Baths here: But the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who are few, have only one Church. The Caſtle is on a ſteep
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:95495:86"/>Hill, between the City, and the Mountain, which I eſteem ſtrong, not being commanded by any higher Ground near it. About it are perceivable ſeveral Ranges of Walls one above another; which it may be, were in antient times the chief part of the City. They ſay, There is kept an antient <hi>Roman</hi> Helmet; but it being too late, we could not have time to go ſee it this Evening; and our Company poſted us away next Morning too early.</p>
            <p>The next Morning therefore, <hi>October</hi> the one and twentieth, early we ſet out from this Town; and in leſs than a Mile, Weſt of it, we began to mount the <hi>Sipylus,</hi> by the eaſieſt Paſſage, and were above three hours before we could look over that part of it, which is not the higheſt by a great deal: for it well deſerves to be reckoned among the higheſt Mountains of <hi>Aſia.</hi> Hence we had a fair Proſpect of the Plain of <hi>Magneſia,</hi> North, ſtretching it ſelf in length Eaſt-ward from the <hi>Ionian</hi> Sea, which we had Weſt-wards; and <hi>Smyrna,</hi> with its fair Port, South-Weſt. And South-Eaſt, not very far off the Place where we were, begin Mountains, which ſtretch themſelves far Eaſt, through the <hi>Leſſer Aſia;</hi> as the Doctor told me, who called it <hi>Elis.</hi> Perhaps it is the beginning of Mount <hi>Taurus.</hi> I would have given much, that I could have had time to ſearch this Mountain, as I did <hi>Olympus.</hi> But our Company were too near home, to be at leiſure for ſuch Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Only I had time to take notice of abundance of that <hi>Origanum</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſcribed: and here I ſaw ſome in its Flowers:<note place="margin">PLANTS AT MOUNT SI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PYLUS.</note> And therefore being the moſt eminent Place, I call it <hi>Origanum montis Sipyli.</hi> To which I add,

It is neareſt like the <hi>Scabioſa argentea, anguſtifolio</hi> of <hi>C. Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinus,</hi> deſcribed in his <hi>Prodromus:</hi> But it is leſs; the Leaves not nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower, but ſhorter, and rounder towards the top, growing without Order near the ground, from a woody Root: from which ſprings a Stalk, I judge, by the bigneſs of that, three or four handfuls high, and branches out into other fine Twigs by pairs: and may be called <hi>Scabioſa Argentea minor.</hi>
                  </item>

               <hi>Smyrna</hi> hath ſo many Advantages from its natural Situation,<note place="margin">SMYRNA.</note> that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the great Calamities which have befallen it by War, and moſt prodigious Earthquakes, that no leſs than ſix times have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, and almoſt utterly ruined it; yet it hath ſtill been thought worth the repairing, and reſtoring to all the Beauty the Art of its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants could contrive to adorn it with: Notwithſtanding alſo, that from ſome old Tradition they expect the Seventh, that ſhall be its utter Ruin, never to be repaired. It is ſituate at the bottom of a Bay, eſteemed twenty Miles to its Mouth, ſecured with high Mountains on every ſide, from all Winds, but the Weſt. Whence from Sea they can receive no damage: For the <hi>Hermus,</hi> which emptieth it ſelf into it, maketh a Bank of Sand, that barreth the raging of the Sea out; yet leaves ſuch a paſſage in, although but narrow, that he muſt be a very Ideot of a Pilot, that cannot bring a Ship in ſafe, into the inmoſt part of the Bay; where he may find room, and depth enough, with very good Moorage. This Bay hath Mount <hi>Sipylus</hi> North. Another Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which I judged to be the <hi>Meſogis mons,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and <hi>Strabo,</hi> North-Eaſt: The Hills, whereon the Town ſtands, from Eaſt to South. From thence to the <hi>Promontory, Argennum,</hi> winding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to the Weſtern point, <hi>Mons Mimas,</hi> now called <hi>the Brothers,</hi> from the two higheſt Points. Here is indeed a little Gap, being the mouth of the Bay: but thence Hills begin to riſe again, to joyn to Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pylus.</hi> Of this Entrance I ſhall have occaſion again to ſpeak, when I part hence. But as to the reſt, theſe Mountains are not ſo uear, but that they leave fruitful Fields round about between the Bay and them;
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:95495:87"/>well planted with Olive-yards, Vine-yards, and Corn-fields among them; and from the Town to Mount <hi>Sipylus</hi> is a Valley of four or more Miles in length, and near a Mile broad in ſome places: which with the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens about the Town, and the Town it ſelf, drink up two pretty Streams of good Water; one riſing North-ward from the Mountain <hi>Sipylus,</hi> and the other Southward, from Mount <hi>Mimas;</hi> which joyn together North-Eaſt of the Town; and what it ſpareth, which is but little, the Sea receiveth at the North-Weſt end of the Town. That which cometh North-wards from Mount <hi>Sipylus,</hi> is a conſiderable Stream, driveth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Mills, and hath abundance of Fiſh in it. The other, coming from Mount <hi>Mimas,</hi> is the greateſt part brought to the Town in <hi>Aqueducts;</hi> two of which are well built with Stone-Arches, croſſing the Valley, or deep Foſs, which it ſelf hath dug between two Hills; whereof the Northern-moſt is where Old <hi>Smyrna</hi> ſtood; now only a Caſtle. The reſt of the Water is divided amongſt the Gardens.</p>

               <hi>Smyrna</hi> is a place of great Antiquity, and is reputed to have had the <hi>Amazon Smyrna</hi> for its Foundreſs. They therefore ſtamped their Money with the Figure of her Head. I got ſeveral pieces of them very rare, and ſaw many more, in the Cabinet of an ingenious Merchant there, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

            <p>Of the antient Situation, and Beauty of this place, <hi>Strabo</hi> giveth the beſt and ſhorteſt Account. <q>Thence, ſaith he, deſcribing it North-ward from <hi>Epheſus,</hi> is another Bay, in which is Old <hi>Smyrna,</hi> twenty <hi>Stadia,</hi> or <hi>two Miles and a half,</hi> from the New. When the <hi>Lydians</hi> had deſtroyed <hi>Smyrna,</hi> the Country thereabout was only inhabited by Villages, for Four hundred Years together. After which <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> reſtored it; and after him <hi>Lyſimachus.</hi> At this day it is of all the <hi>Aſian</hi> Cities, moſt beautiful. Part of it is built upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; but the greater part on the Plain to the Haven, unto the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Mother of the Gods, and to the <hi>Gymnaſium.</hi> The Streets are moſt excellently, and as much as poſſible, reduded into right Angles, all paved with Stone. It hath great and ſquare Porticoes, both in the higher and lower parts of the City. There is a Library, and the <hi>Homerion,</hi> which is a ſquare Portico, with a Temple, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his Statue. For the <hi>Smyrnoites</hi> are very zealous for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of <hi>Homer</hi> amongſt them; and have a braſs piece of Money, called by his Name, <hi>Homerion.</hi> The River <hi>Meles</hi> runneth by the Walls. There is a Haven on the other ſide of the City, which may be ſhut up at pleaſure. Thus far <hi>Strabo.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <pb n="242" facs="tcp:95495:88"/>
            <p>The Old <hi>Smyrna,</hi> that was in his time, in all probability, was on a Hill South of this that is now, and Weſt of the Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill. For there are ſome Steps of Heaps of Stones, laid in ſome order, as if a Wall had been there. His New <hi>Smyrna,</hi> but the Old one of our times, without doubt took up all the Hill the Old Caſtle ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on, and that adjoyning to it, down to a point, running into the Bay Southwards; and of the Plain much more North-Eaſt, than the New <hi>Smyrna</hi> of our times. But North, I believe, not more, if ſo much. For turning into <hi>Franck-Street</hi> is a Wall, which ſeemeth to be part of the antient Walls of the City; although the Mouth of the River <hi>Meles,</hi> is juſt without the preſent Buildings; which is not far, and might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be turned thither, if nearer to the Walls formerly. Along this Wall from the Sea, you come to the Foundations of a great Building of hewed Stone, they were then demoliſhing; which might have been the <hi>Sibyl's</hi> Temple, the great Mother of the Gods.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Homerion</hi> it hath been thought that, which they call the <hi>Temple of Janus,</hi> perhaps from its Similitude to that at <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe it is not far off from the River ſuppoſed to be the River <hi>Meles.</hi> It is a four ſquare Stone-building, about three Yards ſquare, with two doors oppoſite to each other, one North, and the other South; and a large Niche within, againſt the Eaſt-Wall, where his Image was ſuppoſed to ſtand. But my Comrade receiv'd Letters ſince, that digging by it, hath been found a Statue, with a double Viſage; which confirms the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Med.</hi> 39, 40, 42.</note> That it was the Temple of <hi>Janus.</hi> Of the Braſs Money called by <hi>Homer</hi>'s Name, I did light upon one-piece not long ſince, with his Head and Name on one ſide, and the Figure, and Name of the River <hi>Meles</hi> on the other, in <hi>Greek</hi> Characters. I ſaw another among M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keners,</hi> a <hi>Coturniate Medalion,</hi> with his Head and Shoulders, and a Branch before him, having his Name about it. On the Reverſe is a Man, leading a Horſe. <hi>Homer</hi>'s Name, in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Faulkener</hi>'s, begins with Ω; but in mine, with Ο. Where the <hi>Gymnaſium</hi> was, and the many noble <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoes,</hi> which adorned this Place, is now paſt conjecturing. But the Port that did <hi>ſhut,</hi> and <hi>open at pleaſure,</hi> might be that little ſquare place by the Fort, which now ſerves to harbour the Gallies, and other ſmall Boats.</p>
            <p>But other <hi>Remains</hi> of Antiquity, not mentioned by <hi>Strabo,</hi> although none of the leaſt, are the <hi>Theater</hi> and <hi>Cirque.</hi> The <hi>Theater</hi> is on the Brow of the Hill, North of the Caſtle, built of white Marble: but now is going to be deſtroyed, to build the new <hi>Kan,</hi> and <hi>Bazar</hi> hard by the Fort below; which they are now about: and in doing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there hath been lately found, in the Foundation, a Pot of Medals, all of the Emperour <hi>Gadlienus</hi> his Family, and the other Tyrants that reigned in his time; which make me believe he built it, or at leaſt, that it was done in his days: although my Comrade ſeemeth to think, it was the Emperour <hi>Claudius;</hi> becauſe he found his Name on a piece of a <hi>Pedeſtal,</hi> in the Scene of it: But I think without reaſon. For that could be no part of the <hi>Theater;</hi> ſince in the Foundation of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Buildings, it is uſual to find the Coyn of the Founders, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary Emperours.</p>
            <pb n="243" facs="tcp:95495:88"/>
            <p>The <hi>Cirque</hi> is dug deep in the Hill, that is Weſt of the Caſtle, about Two hundred and fifty paces long, and about Forty five broad. This was uſed in Courſes and Games with Horſes, called by the Latins <hi>Circus,</hi> and by the Greeks <hi>Stadium,</hi> when it was only a Hundred and twenty five paces long; but <hi>Diaulos,</hi> when the double, as this is. There are abundance of other antient Foundations of noble Structures; but what they were, is uncertain. We found, and copied many Inſcriptions, and Medals concerning this Place; ſome of which are very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; ſome only Fragments, where the Names of the Emperours, <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius, Claudius,</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> are to be read. Others, Sepulchral Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. There is one, that beſides thoſe that <hi>Strabo</hi> mentioneth for the Reſtorers of this Town, attributeth the ſame to the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> thus: <hi>To the Emperour</hi> Adrian, <hi>Olympian, Saviour, and Founder.</hi>

            <p>But that which was, and ever ſhall be its true Glory, was their ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reception of the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> Glorious in the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny he hath given of them, and happy in the faithful Promiſes he hath made to them. Let us conſider therefore, what he writeth to them by the Evangeliſt, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>John.</hi> Apoc. 2.9. <hi>I know thy Works, and Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Poverty; but thou art Rich.

            <p>Agreeable to which, in thoſe times this Church was as a <hi>Noble Army of Martyrs;</hi> whereof S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Polycarp,</hi> their Paſtor, as their <hi>Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> was martyred either in the <hi>Theater,</hi> or <hi>Cirque,</hi> by wild Beaſts, His Tomb yet remains on the Hill, bounding the North-ſide of the <hi>Cirque,</hi> and is viſited with great Devotion: But his true Glory is on high. Theſe Chriſtians do yet remain conſiderable, and in a far better condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than any of the reſt of thoſe Seven Churches. The <hi>Greeks</hi> that are here, have but two Churches; yet they are numerous, this Place being the Seat of their <hi>Metropolitan.</hi> But beſides them, here is a great number of Chriſtians of all Nations, Sects, and Languages. The <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Church hath a Monaſtery of <hi>Franciſcans:</hi> The <hi>Armenians</hi> have one Church: But the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which are the moſt conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, next the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Armenians,</hi> have only a Chapel in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul</hi>'s Houſe; which is a ſhame, conſidering the great Wealth they heap up here, beyond all the reſt: Yet they commonly excel them in their Paſtor. For I eſteem a good <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prieſt, an Evangeliſt, if compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with any of the reſt. The <hi>Hollanders,</hi> I believe, next to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> are more numerous than any Nation of the <hi>Francks;</hi> and take no more care, as I could learn, of their Religious Worſhip. But as to Trade, none ſtrive to out-vie each other,<note place="margin">TRADE.</note> ſo much as <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander;</hi> whereof <hi>Smyrna</hi> and <hi>Aleppo</hi> are now the chief Places, in the <hi>Levant.</hi> The Trade was formerly pretty well divided between them; but ſince their War with the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of it. The chief Commerce conſiſts in Raw and <hi>Perſian</hi> Silks, Grogorans, both in yarn, and alſo woven, brought to this Scale by the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Armenians:</hi> and much Cotton, raw, and made in yarn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which groweth all about theſe Countries, and the Iſlands of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chipelago;</hi> being brought by the <hi>Greeks</hi> &amp; <hi>Turks,</hi> to be ſold here. The <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Factory conſiſt of fourſcore, or an hundred Perſons, moſt of them younger Sons to Gentlemen; who give three or four hundred pounds to ſome great Merchant of the <hi>Levant</hi> Company; and bind their Sons Apprentices for ſeven Years; three whereof they ſerve at <hi>London,</hi> to underſtand their Maſters Concerns: and then their Maſters are obliged to ſend them to negotiate in theſe Parts, and to find them buſineſs; out of which they are allowed a certain Sum, <hi>per Cent.:</hi> Where by their Induſtry, in Traffick for themſelves alſo, upon good Gains, but little Loſs, they live gentilely, become rich, and get great Eſtates in a ſhort

               <hi>Rycaut</hi> was then <hi>Conſul,</hi> who writ the State and Policy of the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi> Empire, and a Treatiſe of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, an Appendix to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Hiſtory, down to his time, and alſo an Account of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Churches of Aſia.</hi> He was very obliging to us, amongſt other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, in directing and informing us concerning theſe Parts.</p>
            <p>Their Chaplain is allowed Five hundred Dollars a year Salary, by the <hi>Levant</hi> Company: He hath beſides a Ware-Houſe allowed him, to trade with, beſides cuſtomary Gifts of all the Merchants yearly; which amount commonly to much more. And indeed the whole Factory do live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the greateſt Unity, Peace, and Freedom of any of them I have ſeen beyond Sea.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> have alſo their <hi>Conſuls</hi> here; but are in no great Credit amongſt the <hi>Turks.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> have the beſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, for their honeſt dealing: and therefore ordinarily their Word is taken inſtead of Searching. But the <hi>Armenians</hi> pay more Cuſtom than any.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> have thirteen <hi>Moſques,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> ſeveral Synagogues: All which makes the Town populous, though ill built, and without either Strength or Beauty. All that defends it from the Incurſions of <hi>Corſaires,</hi> is a little Fort at the Strait coming in, about five Miles from the Town; whoſe great Guns are its beſt ſecurity: For it hath but a little Ditch about it; and the Walls ſuch, as by two or three great Guns would ſoon be beat to the ground. As to the Caſtle on the Hill above the Town, it is ſlighted: and although it hath the old Wall about it, I believe, built by the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperours; yet it is only a heap of Ruins within, with here and there ſome arched Caves, uſed antiently for Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns or Granaries, as ſome think, having only two or three little Guns, mounted againſt the Haven, to ſalute the Captain of the Gallies; or, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Smith</hi> ſaith, the New Moon at <hi>Bairam.</hi> About the Walls are ſet one or two of the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles, well cut, and another <hi>Baſſo-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievo</hi> of Men on Horſe-back. Over the Door is an Inſcription in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in the later <hi>Greek</hi> Characters; but too high and difficult to be read.</p>
            <p>There is another little old faſhion'd Caſtle, at the Harbour, for the Gallies and Boats. On the other ſide of which Harbour is the Scale, or Cuſtom-houſe for the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> own Subjects: Beyond which
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:95495:90"/>South-wards, under the Hill, where S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

            <p>About <hi>Smyrna</hi> are abundance of <hi>Camelions;</hi>
               <note place="margin">CAMELIONS.</note> which is an <hi>Animal</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing reſembling a <hi>Lizard;</hi> but hath his back gibbous, like a Hog; and its Feet are divided like the Claws of a <hi>Wood-pecker,</hi> or <hi>Parrot;</hi> two Claws before, and three behind; which are not ſeparated from each other, until near the ends. A long Tail it hath, like a Rat, and is ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as big: but it hath very little, or no Motion with its Head. They are in great abundance about the old Walls of the Caſtle; where they breed, and lie in holes, and heaps of Ruins. Several we ſaw; and two we kept twenty days at leaſt: in which time we made theſe following Obſervations upon them.</p>
            <p>Their Colour uſeth to be green, darker toward the back, and lighter towards the Belly, inclining to a yellow, with ſpots ſometimes of a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh colour, and ſometimes whitiſh. But the green would often change into a dark dirt-colour, without any appearance of green.<note place="margin">COLOUR,</note> The whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Spots would ſometimes vaniſh, or turn into the ſame dirt-colour, and ſometime remain. Sometimes they would only change into a darker colour, of a kind of purple-like tincture; which uſed often to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:95495:91"/>when it was diſturbed. Sometimes, from a green all over, they would be ſpotted with a pure black; which alſo happened ſometimes, when it returned from the black. Ordinarily, when it ſlept under a white woollen Cap, it would, when uncovered; be of a white, or cream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour. But this it would do alſo, under a red Cap. I never ſaw any change red, or blue, although they have been laid upon thoſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours often, and continued there a long time. But upon green they would become green, and upon the dark Earth they would ſoon change to that colour. One of the ſame bigneſs of which you ſee the Figure, I caught, as I was walking on the ſide of the Hill, near the old Caſtle; where I ſaw many, which had changed themſelves to the colour of the ſpeckled Stone-walls, to a grey with ſpots, like Moſs. This I found on the top of a green buſh of <hi>Prunella Spinoſa;</hi> which, when I firſt caſt my eye upon it, was of a bright, green colour; but as ſoon as it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that I ſaw it, it immediately let it ſelf drop to the ground; and I as ſoon ſtooped to look for it, but could ſee nothing: yet continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to look about earneſtly, at laſt I perceived it creeping away to a Hole in the Rock, being changed to a dark, brown colour, exactly like the Earth; which was then of that colour, after a ſhower of Rain.</p>
            <p>This changing of Colours is given to this Creature by Nature, for its Preſervation. For it is very ſlow in its pace, lifting up its Legs high, and not quick, as if they ſaw not the way before them; or rather, as if they ſearched for hold to climb up by; which they can do very well on an Herb, Tree, or Wall. When it ſaw it ſelf in danger to be caught, it opened its Mouth, and hiſſed like a Snake. In a ſmall time after I put it into my Handkerchief, it turned of the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, white, with ſome Spots, and a little tincture of red. This little one changed its colour more nimbly, than others that were greater. The cauſe of which I attribute to the wildneſs of it; the other, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been kept a good while before it was given us, and conſequently tamer.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Eyes</hi> are as wonderful as the <hi>Colours;</hi>
               <note place="margin">THE EYES.</note> which are, as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> hath remarked, large in proportion to the bigneſs of its Head; being commonly bigger, and larger than a Pea. But that which ſeems moſt obſervable, his Lordſhip hath taken no notice of It is covered all over with a thick Skin, of the ſame ſubſtance with the Body, the Grain being in circles, juſt to the center or middle; where there is a hole, no bigger than a ſmall Pins-head, by which it receives Light: which muſt make the Angle of its Viſion very acute.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Head</hi> being immoveable,<note place="margin">THE HEAD.</note> it cannot turn it ſelf to the Objects, as it liſteth. But, to malee amends for all ſuch Inconveniences, Nature hath given moſt wonderful Motions to its Eyes, beyond any other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creature. It can, not only move them, at the ſame time, both forward and backward, upward and downward; but alſo one forward, the other backward; the one upward, the other downward; the one fixed on one Object, and the other moving according to the motion of ſome other Object; and ſo is capable of all the changes imaginable: which my Comrade and I often experimented with a great deal of Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
            <pb n="249" facs="tcp:95495:91"/>
            <p>The <hi>Tongue</hi> is a kind of little Trunk,<note place="margin">THE TONGUE.</note> of a griſtly Subſtance, above half an inch long and hollow, joyned to his Throat by a ſtrong Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous, and fleſhy Subſtance; in which it is ſheathed, when it is in the Mouth. It will dart this out of its Mouth above an Inch, being ſmeared with a glutinous Subſtance, to catch Flies, which ſtick faſt to it, as to Bird-lime; and ſo are brought into its Mouth.<note place="margin">FOOD.</note> Theſe Flies are their ordinary known Food; although I never ſaw them catch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: but ſaw one, that was almoſt dead, having a Fly in its Mouth. The reſt of its Suſtenance is Air; of which it will fill it ſelf, being ſet out in the Sun, until it becometh much ſwollen.</p>
            <p>Of its Excrement I remarked nothing: But my Comrade telleth, That a Perſon of Curioſity at <hi>Lyons,</hi> aſſured him from his own Obſervations, That although the <hi>Camelion</hi> did eat little, or nothing; yet it nevertheleſs made much Excrement. They will live without any Suſtenance, beſides Air, a very great while; as will many other <hi>Animals,</hi> of the like cold Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>viz. Serpents</hi> and <hi>Lizards,</hi> &amp;c. One that I opened, had Guts; but I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived nothing in them: but the reaſon, I believe, was, becauſe it was even ſtarved; having been kept a great while, and then almoſt dead.</p>
            <p>Its <hi>Lungs</hi> reach near the length of its Body, conſiſting of a thin,<note place="margin">THE LUNGS.</note> skinny Subſtance, full of ſmall Veins, and divided into two <hi>Labels,</hi> placed on each ſide, and filled with Air; which being let out, thoſe <hi>Labels</hi> ſhrunk together.</p>
            <p>Its <hi>Tail</hi> is of very great uſe to it in climbing. It will twine it about a Bone, or a Stick ſo faſt, that if it let go,<note place="margin">THE TAIL.</note> or falls ſhort in reaching at any thing elſe with its Claws, it will hang faſt by the Tail, and ſuſtain and recover its whole Body by it. The little one that I caught, I put it into a Glaſs, ſo deep, that it could not reach the Brim with its Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feet by much, ſlor could take any hold with its Claws; and yet it got it ſelf out, and almoſt eſcaped from me; as I ſaw afterwards, by ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon its Fore-feet, and hoiſting it ſelf up backwards, until it catched hold of the brim of the Glaſs with its Tail; by the help whereof, it lifted all its whole Body out.</p>
            <p>And this is what I obſerved of this wonderful <hi>Animal;</hi> which thus challengeth Praiſe for its Creator, the Lord of all Wonder.</p>
            <p>Here are abundance of <hi>Pellicans;</hi> of which I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak another time. And my good Friend, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Ent,</hi> told me, That he obſerved, that many Fowls, eſpecially <hi>Teal,</hi> have here a long Claw on their Wings, like the Spurs of a Cock. When I was in <hi>Boeotia,</hi> I had a <hi>Lapwing</hi> ſhot, that had ſo.</p>
            <p>Here the Sheep are very large; but that which is extraordinary, is,<note place="margin">SHEEP.</note> That they have a prodigious broad Tail, covering all the Rump; it being a meer lump of Fat on the Bones: And, I am ſure, I ſpeak with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in compaſs, they often weigh eight or ten pounds, if not more. This of Lambs, is eſteem'd as good as any Marrow; but of old Sheep, is no better than Tallow, and their Wool is courſe.</p>
            <p>Here I obſerved in the Hedges a kind of <hi>Jujuba,</hi> like that I deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed at the Mouth of the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> as to its ſilver colour.<note place="margin">PLANTS at SMYRNA.</note> But the Subſtance of the Wood of this, is more hard and knotty, of a dark, brown colour, like a Crab-tree; it hath here and there long and ſharp Thorns, and the Leaves much larger and broader, than thoſe others. I do not find either this, or the other, deſcribed by <hi>Gerard:</hi> unleſs, perchance, the other narrow one be it, which he calleth <hi>Zizypha Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padociea.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="250" facs="tcp:95495:92"/>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Smyrnion</hi> groweth with here in great plenty; <hi>viz.</hi> that which we call <hi>Smyrnion Creticum,</hi> or <hi>Cardy-Alexanders:</hi> which the likeneſs of the Name, makes the to believe, it took its Name rather from hence.</p>
            <p>But an <hi>Origanum</hi> I found, growing plentifully in the Caſtle, on the Hill, is a Plant I eſteem one of the moſt curious I have gathered. It is a perennial Plant, ſending up long, woody Stalks, beſet with little Branches, at ſeveral diſtances, and Leaves ſmaller than the <hi>Candy-Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram;</hi> not ſo round, not white, but more long than broad, ending with a ſharp point, ribbed, and a little downy. On the top is a Tuſt of ſmall, ſcaly Seeds, like <hi>Dodder Graſs;</hi> and the whole Plant of a moſt fragrant Smell. Of this I brought a great deal of Seed, to furniſh our curious Gardens with; but without Succeſs.</p>
            <p>The Ships then in Port, bound to touch at <hi>Zant,</hi> and ſo for <hi>England,</hi> being not ready to part for ſome days, we were reſolved to go vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit <hi>Epheſus;</hi> which is not above a day and half's Journey South of <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi> We hired Horſes of an <hi>Armenian;</hi> who ſerved both for our Guide and Interpreter: And for our Janizary, by the <hi>Conſul</hi>'s Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we took one by the way, at <hi>Jamouraſi,</hi> a pleaſant Village, about fifteen Miles from <hi>Smyrna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, <hi>October</hi> the Fourth, we ſet out from <hi>Smyrna;</hi> and firſt, going out of the Town, we paſſed a little River behind the Caſtle, running into the <hi>Meles;</hi> whence mounting a ſteep Hill, it gave us the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of a pleaſant Plain, South-ward, bounded on the Weſt with the Mountains, diſtinguiſhed in old times by the Names of <hi>Corycus</hi> and <hi>Coricius,</hi> unto the Gulph of <hi>Colophon.</hi> They are well ſtored with Hogs, and other Chaſe. Through this Plain we paſſed, leaving <hi>Sediqui</hi> a little on the left hand,<note place="margin">JEMOURASI.</note> about half way to <hi>Jemouraſi;</hi> where we lay that Evening, and were carried by our <hi>Janizary</hi> hence, to ſee the Governour; who hath a pretty convenient Seat, according to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Mode, and entertain'd us civilly. The little Moſques, and Sepulchers here, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prettily adorned with Cypreſs-Trees about them. From hence there is a ſtreight way over the Mountain, called by the <hi>Turks</hi> the <hi>Aleman;</hi> and much the neareſt way of the three, leading to <hi>Epheſus.</hi> But our Janizary aſſured us, That there were Robbers then abroad; and that it was much the ſecureſt, to go the Eaſtern-way, although it was more about, than either that by the Sea, or that over the Mountain. For this way, keeping ſtill the Plain, they could not have the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of ſetting on us unawares, nor at a diſadvantage, if we did meet with them: and, in a word, that otherways he would not venture with us. We therefore took his advice, and went the left hand way, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thence early in the Morning, <hi>October</hi> the fifth.</p>
            <p>In about an hour and half we paſſed a little Stream, which in times paſt was, as is believed, the River <hi>Halys,</hi> that runs to <hi>Colophon,</hi> and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth it ſelf in that Bay; which ſometimes, upon the advantage of ground, I could diſcern between the Mountains: but perceived no ſuch extraordinary Coldneſs in the Water, as the antient Report of this <hi>Halys.</hi> Further on the Plain we paſſed over four Streams more; which ſeen to go the ſame way: but coming nearer to the Foot of the <hi>Aleman,</hi> we paſſed by the Ruins of an <hi>Aqueduct,</hi> that cometh thence, and goeth ſtreight down to a Village,<note place="margin">TOURBALI.</note> called <hi>Tourbali,</hi> a Mile or two thence on
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:95495:92"/>the left hand, down over the Plain: Which hath been thought of ſome to be the City <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Ionia.</hi> We kept ſtill under this Mountain, on the right hand of us, and ſometimes paſſed over a paved way, and through Woods; in which I obſerved many great <hi>Turpentine</hi> Trees, as big as Aſhes or Oaks with us; and upon the brow of the Mountain, and down to the Plain, whole Woods of <hi>Olive</hi> Trees growing wild. I could ſee no difference betwen theem, and the Garden-Olives of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca:</hi> They bear more Olives, than the Inhabitants are able to gather to make Oyl of. About noon we came to a large Burying-Place of the <hi>Turks;</hi> having abundance of broken Pillars, and other Marble Stones, placed in the ground for Grave-Stones. There we alighted to bait under a curious large Maſtick Tree, which hung full of drops of <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine;</hi> which made me believe, That it was only want of Induſtry, that they made not as much profit of it on the main Land, as in the Iſle of <hi>Scio:</hi> which hath monopolized all the Glory and Profit of that excellent Juyce.</p>
            <p>But my Comrade and I were ſoon ranſacking thoſe Stones, to ſee if from them we could learn any more, than from the more ſtupid People of theſe parts. But we found only one Stone, engraven with Letters little to our purpoſe: Yet looking ſtill about, over the Hedge, juſt by, we ſaw many Ruins, Caves, and Walls; which made us think,<note place="margin">CABAGEA, or METROPO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIS.</note> that this might be the City <hi>Metropolis,</hi> it being not far above Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from <hi>Smyrna;</hi> upon that which was the Military way, as the Pavement in many places, yet remaining, aſſures us; and in effect, our <hi>Armenian,</hi> when we told him our Thoughts, <hi>viz.</hi> That there had been a City there, did likewiſe aſſure us, That thoſe of <hi>Cabagea,</hi> about a Mile thence, on the brow of the Hill, told him, That there had been a City there; and that the word <hi>Cabagea</hi> ſignified a <hi>Great City,</hi> and belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed properly to this Place: though the Village, called <hi>Cabagea,</hi> conſiſts now only of fifteen, or twenty Houſes; yet it ſtill continues the Name of the City, as being near to the Ruins of it. And probably, it is not long ſince this Town, or City, hath been deſtroyed. For hereabouts are four or five great Burying-places of the <hi>Turks;</hi> which argues, That in times paſt, thoſe places have not been ſo depopulated, as now they are. All this, with the direction we took from <hi>Strabo,</hi> we put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and concluded, That here ſtood the City <hi>Metropolis,</hi> in antient times. It hath from the brow of the Mountain, at the foot of which it is ſituated, a good Proſpect over the Plain, North and Eaſt. But I am not of my Comrade's opinion, That this Mountain, now called the <hi>Aleman,</hi> was called <hi>Mimas</hi> in old time: but that it is rather the <hi>Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius mons,</hi> which <hi>Strabo</hi> puts between <hi>Colophon</hi> and <hi>Epheſus:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. <hi>13.</hi>
               </note> but pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>Mons Mimas,</hi> near <hi>Erythraea,</hi> in the <hi>Cherſoneſus</hi> by <hi>Smyrna,</hi> after <hi>Mons Corycus</hi> and <hi>Coracius,</hi> by <hi>Argennum Promontorium;</hi> and is now called <hi>The Brothers,</hi> entring the Gulph of <hi>Smyrna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two or three Miles further, through a deſolate Wood, we came to the River <hi>Caiſter;</hi>
               <note place="margin">CAISTER. <hi>Fluv.</hi>
               </note> hard by which we ſaw ſix Horſe-men coming down from the Mountain, croſſing the Road to way-lay us; and as ſoon as they came to the way, they ſtopped, and ranged all on one ſide of the way. Our Janizary rid fore-moſt up to them, and talked a little with them: In the mean time I endeavoured to paſs by at a diſtance;
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:95495:93"/>which the furthermoſt perceiving, went ſtill along with me. But I kept my hand on the Cock of my Carabine; and my Comrade fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a foot pace, as well armed; and our Janizary better than either of us both: but our <hi>Armenian</hi> had only a Scimeter. After a little diſcourſe they all gabbled in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Language together, wiſhing us a good Journey, and away they went another way. Our Janizary told us, That they asked him, what we were, and whither we were going? and he told them, That we had nothing with us worth their taking, That we were his Friends, and going only to take the Air. They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, So were they; and forthwith marched from us. He that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like their Chief, was an <hi>Arab,</hi> a large timber'd, tall Fellow, with a <hi>Saracen</hi>'s Head. They were alſo well arm'd with Swords, Darts, Bows, and Spears: but I perceiv'd no Fire-Arms they had; which might be the great reaſon they did not ſet on us, ſeeing us ſo well fitted. For I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, they were ſuch as uſed to pillage poor Houſes, and Villages, not able to make reſiſtance. We were told at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> That they were but part of Eighteen; who thus had divided themſelves in three ways, from <hi>Smyrna</hi> to <hi>Epheſus: viz.</hi> Six by the Sea, near <hi>Scala Nova;</hi> Six on the Mountains, and Six this way. Our Janizary pretended Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with them, and that his Father had been formerly one of them; and that for his ſake they let us alone. But whatever the inſtrumental Means was, my Comrade and I concluded, That it was the Merciful Hand of God towards us; and therefore to Him, as it was moſt juſt, we gave the Praiſe; who never faileth thoſe, that put their Truſt in Him.</p>
            <p>Not far from hence we began to turn the Promontory of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, if I may ſo call it; upon whoſe high Clifts I ſaw the Ruins of a Caſtle, and loſt the River <hi>Caiſter,</hi> until we came to a narrow Valley between two Mountains; where again we recovered the River, and paſſed it over by a Stone-Bridge, about a couple of Miles from the Caſtle of <hi>Epheſus;</hi> where we arrived a little before it was dark.</p>

               <hi>Epheſus</hi> is built in a fine Plain,<note place="margin">EPHESUS.</note> ſtretched in length Weſt-ward to the Sea, I believe four or five Miles; and may be, in many places, two at leaſt broad; ſo encompaſſed about with high Mountains, and rocky Clifts on the North, Eaſt, and South ſides, in ſo juſt a proportion, that I can fanſie it reſembleth nothing more, than the <hi>Cirques,</hi> and the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums</hi> of the Antients. It hath the Mountain <hi>Gallecius</hi> on the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, from the Sea to the Paſſage, through which the River <hi>Caiſter</hi> runs. Parallel to that, South, it hath the Mountain <hi>Correſius,</hi> if I gueſs right, out of <hi>Strabo,</hi> running from Weſt to Eaſt; and thence, bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up circular, fortifieth the Eaſt ſide as well as the South. The Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Caiſter</hi> runneth through it, entring the Paſſage between the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and leaving the City South of it, after various windings and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings through the Plain, mixeth it ſelf with the Sea, near the Weſtern Promontory of the South Mountain. For the City was built on the South ſide the River, principally upon two Rocks, about half a Mile from each other. The firſt is near the Eaſt end of the Plain; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Caſtle now ſtandeth, guarded by the <hi>Turks:</hi> which ſeemeth to be of no older date, than the later <hi>Greek</hi> Emperours; being built of other more antient Ruins, as the Fragments of more curious pieces of Marble, careleſly mixed among the other Stones, aſſured us. Over the Gate of it are ſet three large Tables of Marble, carved in <hi>Baſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relievo.</hi> The firſt is quite defaced, the middle one is of excellent Work. The firſt Figure of it is a Horſe, with a Man lying under his feet; who ſeemeth to have an antient <hi>Armenian</hi> Bonnet on his Head. A little further is another Figure, holding the foot of the firſt Man, ſeeming to drag him along. The next is a Woman in an humble Poſture, demanding ſomewhat of another Figure, ſtanding in a <hi>Roman</hi> Habit; ſo that it ſeems
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:95495:94"/>to be ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Triumph: but what, it is uncertain. Some have thought it to repreſent the Deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> and <hi>Hector</hi> drawn by the Chariot of <hi>Achilles;</hi> but no Chariot is there to be ſeen. Others, That it repreſented the Perſecution of the Primitive Chriſtians under the <hi>Romans,</hi> with leſs probability. Further within this Gate, on the Caſtle Wall, we ſaw a Marble, whereon is cut a Face, repreſenting the <hi>Moon,</hi> with two Snakes; one on one ſide of the Head, and the other on the other; joyning their Heads in the middle of the Crown, and their Tails pointing outwards; with each of them a Circle in ſuch ſhape, that they both together repreſent a Bow. The Figure I deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, and did not perceive any thing of a Bow, otherwiſe than as I deſcribed. Which was to repreſent the Heathen Deity, they called <hi>Hecate Triformis:</hi> The <hi>Moon</hi> in the Heavens, repreſented by the large round Viſage; <hi>Proſerpine</hi> in Hell, repreſented by the Snakes; and <hi>Diana</hi> upon Earth, by the Bow.</p>

            <p>Coming into the Town, North of this, we found two or three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, half in the ground. From one of them we could only learn the erecting of an Image to the Goddeſs <hi>Diana,</hi> as the whole City was filled with her ſuperſtitious Worſhip: And on the right hand of the way, we left the ruins of an Aqueduct, coming from the Eaſtern-hills to the Caſtle; which, as I underſtood by thoſe that gave it me, had this Inſcription on it in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek;</hi> which was its Dedication to the Honour of <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and <hi>Tiberius, Caeſars,</hi> and to the City of <hi>Epheſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But my Companion mentions it about ſix Miles off, on an Aqueduct near <hi>Scala Nova;</hi> but undoubtedly he is miſtaken; for the Inſcription it ſelf, although not well copied, proveth it ſo: For, not knowing of any Inſcription on it, until we returned, we contented our ſelves with
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:95495:94"/>a view of it at a diſtance. But it being both in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them together, I have found the Errours of both, and reſtored it thus:

            <p>The whole Face of the Earth about them, is covered with Ruins, fragment of Marble, Pedeſtals, Pillars, and all parts of moſt antient, and noble ſtructure; now broken, maim'd, and diſunited. I ſaw in the Street an Inſcription almoſt defaced, upon a Marble Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.</p>
            <p>But that which moſt of all was the Object of our Curioſity in this part of the Town, was the Church of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>John</hi> the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, which we deſired to ſee, and with much ado obtain'd of the ſcrupulous Keeper, for half a Dollar, for my ſelf, and Monſieur <hi>Spon,</hi> paſſing for my Scrivan or Clerk; which he might then eaſily do, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Pen and Ink in his Hand: and for this Device we were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to our <hi>Armenian.</hi> This Church is now ſacrilegiouſly tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a <hi>Mahumetan Moſque.</hi> It ſtands on the Weſt-ſide of the Caſtle, and is no extraordinary Edifice. It hath a Court on the North-ſide, and is a long Building, ſtanding Eaſt and Weſt, covered with a double Roof, leaded, and ſuſtained in the middle with three Pillars of Granate Marble, moſt admirably well poliſhed; one of which is twelve Foot, and eleven Inches in compaſs, with a white Marble Capital of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Order.</hi> The other two want not much of this; but their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals are of the ill-favour'd modern <hi>Greek</hi> faſhion. Their Pedeſtals are not ſeen; ſo they may be further in the Ground, than is imagined. On each Roof there is a little ill-proportioned <hi>Cuppalo;</hi> and in the Court another Capital of the <hi>Compound Order,</hi> with ſome broken pieces of Pillars; which might have made a Cloyſter about it in times paſt.</p>
            <pb n="257" facs="tcp:95495:95"/>
            <p>Thence we took Horſe, to ſee the other Rocky Hill, half a Mile South-wards; where, probably, was the greateſt part of the City, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> as <hi>Strabo</hi> affirmeth. On the Eaſtern top of which we diſcovered Ruins, and were carried firſt into a Cave under ground, about ſix or eight Foot <hi>Diameter.</hi> It is incruſted above with Congelations, that make it a moſt pretty <hi>Grotto.</hi> Hard by we ſaw a circular Place in the Hill, made like a Theater; but now, in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, deſtroyed. A little further North-wards, but ſtill on the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Rock, goeth in a place with Arches fallen down, with ſome Figures of a ruined Church; where they tell you, was the Cave of the <hi>Seven Sleepers;</hi> who in the Perſecution, in the time of the Emperour <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> hiding themſelves in a Cave, fell aſleep, and awaked not till about Two hundred Years after; thinking they had ſlept but one Night. One cannot believe, but they were ſtrangely aſtoniſhed, when they found how the face of the City was changed, their Friends and Acquaintance all dead, their Money unknown, and not currant, and all People become Chriſtians. This Rock hath been curiouſly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the Entrance, by the Piety of former Ages.</p>
            <p>Going yet forwards under the ſame Hill, yet ſtill Weſt-wards, we paſt by many vaſt Heaps of Ruins, now without form, or likeneſs to any thing with a Name. Only one, which is known to be a <hi>Cirque,</hi> or <hi>Stadium,</hi> by its Figure and Length, and ſeemeth to have had a kind of <hi>Theater</hi> at the end of it, being circular, and as it were ſeparate from the reſt by a Wall: Whence two Walls run parallel a great length Weſt-wards, with Arches underneath for Walks, and Wild Beaſts. The Figure of which I took, becauſe I had not noted any like it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>Parallel to this is the Ruins of an <hi>Amphitheater,</hi> in view of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Diana,</hi> and not very far from it; where, in all likelihood, all the Rabble of the City met together, to vindicate the Honour of their <hi>Goddeſs Diana,</hi> of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> upon the account of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> the <hi>Silver-Smith,</hi> who made <hi>Silver-Shrines</hi> for Men to perform their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Devotion to their great <hi>Goddeſs,</hi> and <hi>He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Image,</hi> which, as they believ'd, <hi>fell down from Jupiter.</hi> It would be wiſhed, there were not ſo many of ſuch Crafts-men in theſe times; by whoſe means Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſo much promoted. A little further, under the Weſt-ſide of the Hill, is a Marble-Arch; which I gueſs was the Front of a Chriſtian Church, built out of the Ruins of ſome more antient Edifice: its Walls being full of Fragments of Inſcriptions, and other carved Stones, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the reſt, without any regard to their former ſtate. Some are well preſerved; but were too high for us to make any thing of them, without a Ladder; which, I hope, will be done by the next, that ſhall have the Curioſity to viſit this Place.</p>
            <p>Yet a little further South-Weſt, is a great <hi>Baſin</hi> of a mixed Marble, of Red and White. Some call it <hi>Porphyry;</hi> but I rather, with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Spon,</hi> believe it to be <hi>Jaſper:</hi> but doubt, whether it is more than an ordinary mixed Marble. <hi>Porphyry</hi> is a very hard red Stone, ſpeck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:95495:96"/>with ſmall white Spots; but the mixture of this is in veins, and not hard enough for either <hi>Porphyry</hi> or <hi>Jaſper.</hi> It is fifteen Foot <hi>Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> and is thought to be the Font S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>John</hi> baptized in, when he was at <hi>Epheſus.</hi> But I hardly think it conſiſtent with the private Exerciſe of Chriſtian Religion in thoſe times. It was all of one Stone; but hath now many pieces broken off. Hard by this are the Ruins of a little round Temple; and about a Bow-ſhot further we were conducted to a great heap of Ruins, ſuppoſed to be that famous Temple of <hi>Diana of the Epheſians.</hi> Of what Figure her Temple was, I know not: But I am not of opinion, That theſe Ruins were of that ſhape Monſieur <hi>Spon</hi> ſpeaketh of; <hi>viz.</hi> That the length was double the breadth; nor that the Front was towards the Eaſt, but the Weſt; which I obſerved from the top of a Wall I climbed up to. For there is a heap of curious Marble before it, at that end; which ſeemed to have been a <hi>Portico,</hi> and to which the Arches more inward ſeem to concur: And ſtill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving about me, I fanſied, that I ſaw the ſame ſhape with that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed at <hi>Troy,</hi> or <hi>Alexandria,</hi> with a Court Weſt-ward; where are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, and as I there marked upon Paper, the Pedeſtals of Pillars; as if there had been other <hi>Portico</hi>'s, on each hand oppoſite to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. There are Foundations of Walls alſo Eaſt-ward, for Gardens and Conveniences of the Building, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Smith</hi> alſo hath obſerved: who believeth, That it hath been a Chriſtian Church; but built out of the Ruins, and upon the Foundations of that Temple. But nothing of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great certainty can now be reported from this rude heap; only that here was the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> once built, as the vaſt proportion of the Pillars, that lie towards the Eaſt-ſide, and the nearneſs to the Lake <hi>Selenuſia,</hi> which was dedicated to <hi>Diana,</hi> and lieth near the River, on the North-Weſt of the Building, demonſtrate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Strabo</hi> telleth alſo, That <hi>Cheiromocrates</hi> was the Architect of this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the ſame that built that at <hi>Alexandria.</hi> If he mean that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria</hi> near <hi>Troy,</hi> as in all likelihood he doth; I know not why he might not be the Architect of that Temple, I before deſcribed there. And indeed, their Form ſo well reſembling one another, and the pieces of Arches that remain, conſiſting of Brick and Stone, that ſeem to have been covered within with ſome Metal, by the Holes which yet remain orderly in rowes for ſome ſuch purpoſe, aſſuring me, That the Building is not modern, incline me much to be of opinion, That both are the Remains of the Temples of <hi>Diana.</hi> The Foundations of this Temple have worthily been eſteemed a Labyrinth, from the many turnings, and windings, with great and little Arches in rowes: But whether it were deſigned for one or no, matters not; it being but neceſſary to have ſuch a Foundation, to ſo vaſt a Pile of Building, in ſo wet and moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh a Place. We went down to it by a long Pack-thred, tied to the Hole where we firſt entred; and with all the Light our Candles had, we made no great Diſcoveries: But when wearied with the thick Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours of the Place, we returned to the freſh Air. Thence we rid a quarter of a Mile further Weſt, to a little Hill, on which is a Building of white Marble, called <hi>Saint Paul</hi>'s <hi>Priſon.</hi> I confeſs, the Building is ſtrong enough for the Name, conſiſting of good thick Walls of well-hewen Marble, and undoubtedly very antient: It is divided into four
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:95495:96"/>Rooms, and hath but one Entrance: But the Convenience of the Place ſeems rather to argue, that it was made for a Watch-Tower, than for a Priſon. For it hath a Proſpect over the whole Plain; which thence, with great delight, I viewed, and obſerved the City lying Eaſt-wards, the Sea Weſt-ward; and the River <hi>Caiſter,</hi> doubling it ſelf into ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Snaky Poſtures over the whole Plain, that it hath made ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it to be the <hi>Meander,</hi> who had never ſeen the true one in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi> Hence I diſcovered alſo another ſmall Lake on the Northern-ſide of the Plain, and of the River, with ſome little Hills near it: And, to conclude, here I obſerved the Situation of all I have hitherto deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; and with great pleaſure, marked them on a Paper; from which I have transferred them to your view.</p>
            <p>That this River is the <hi>Caiſter,</hi> is evident by all antient Teſtimony, which the Money of <hi>Epheſus</hi> confirmeth; whereof in ſeveral Medals I have ſeen of the Emperours <hi>Valerianus, Gallienus,</hi> and <hi>Salonina,</hi> with two we bought at <hi>Smyrna;</hi> one of which I have,<note place="margin">58.</note> and the other Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Spon</hi> reſerveth; are theſe Letters on the Reverſe,
ΕΦΕϹΙΩΝ ΚΑΥϹΤΡΟϹ,
with a ſedent Figure; repreſenting this River, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Reed in one hand, a <hi>Cornucopia</hi> in the other; and leaning on an Urn, pouring out Water.</p>
            <p>But now I am ſpeaking of Medals, it will not be amiſs to give you an account of ſome others that we ſaw, and have, concerning this Place. On ſome we find, that this City was ſtiled <hi>The Chief City of Aſia,</hi>
ΕΦΕϹΙΩΝ ΠΡΩΤΩΝ ΑϹΙΑϹ;
as one I have of <hi>Herenia He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracilla;</hi> the Reverſe hath <hi>Diana,</hi> in a hunting poſture, with her Bow in her hand, having ſhot her Arrow, and ſet her Dog to purſue after the Chace. Her Habit is a ſhort Veſt to her Knees, and Buskins half way her Legs. On the Reverſe of another, of the Emperour <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus,</hi> is <hi>Diana</hi> in the ſame poſture, in a Wood of Olive-Trees. But my Companion hath one <hi>Medalion,</hi> where <hi>Diana</hi> is repreſented with many Dugs, as <hi>Minutius Felix</hi> obſerveth, that the <hi>Epheſian Diana</hi> was. It is of the Emperour <hi>Septimius Severus;</hi> the Reverſe whereof hath a ſedent Figure, holding another Figure, ſtanding up right in his hand, made juſt like many antient Images I have ſeen at <hi>Rome,</hi> full of Dugs; which the Antiquaries call <hi>Dea Mammea,</hi> the <hi>Goddeſs with Dugs:</hi> and theſe Letters are about it, ΖΕΥϹ ΑΚΡΕΙΟϹ ΠΡΩΤΩΝ ΑϹΙΑϹ ΕΦΕϹΙΩΝ,
<hi>Jupiter of the Rocks, or Promontories, of the Epheſians, the principal City of all Aſia:</hi> Which made me believe, That this Image held in his hand, repreſented that of <hi>Diana,</hi> which they feigned fell down from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and was ſo ſacred in this Temple. Another there is among M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Faulkener</hi>'s Collections; which I hope one day to ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, in the <hi>Oxford</hi> Library: where the ſame Figure is joyned with <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> with theſe Letters about it,
ΕΦΕϹΙΩΝ ΠΕΡ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ΓΑΜΕΝΩΝ ΟΜΟΝΟΙΑ;
ſignifying a Confederacy between <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus</hi> and <hi>Epheſus:</hi> and this was of the Emperour <hi>Gallienus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I had ſeen, and conſidered all this Deſolation, How could I chuſe but lament the Ruin of this Glorious Church! To ſee their Candleſtick, and Them removed, and their whole Light utterly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed! Theſe Objects ought to make Us, that yet enjoy His Mercy, tremble, and earneſtly contend to find out <hi>from whence we are fallen,</hi>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:95495:97"/>and do daily fall from bad to worſe: That God is a God of <hi>purer Eyes,</hi> than <hi>to behold Iniquity;</hi> and ſeeing the <hi>Axe</hi> thus long ſince <hi>put to the Root of the Tree,</hi> Should it not make us repent, and turn to God, <hi>leſt we likewiſe periſh?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We did intend in our Return over the Mountain, to have ſeen the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> cut with his Sword, as the honeſt Peaſants tell: But we had ſpent ſo much time here, that we were afraid of loſing the way, and being benighted on the Mountain among thoſe Robbers that had beſet all the ways. So we returned the ſame way we came; and left <hi>Epheſus</hi> about Noon, <hi>Octob.</hi> 6. after little more than a Night, and half a Days ſtay there. I remarked both coming and returning, that the Brow of the Mountains were covered with Olive-Trees; that the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſian</hi> Plain had much <hi>Tamerisk</hi> growing about it;<note place="margin">PLANTS.</note> and by the Caſtle I obſerved ſeveral great Orchards of Apricock-Trees; and among the Ruins in the Caſtle I ſaw much <hi>Ricinus;</hi> whereof I gathered a good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Seeds. Upon the Hill, whereon ſtandeth <hi>Saint Paul</hi>'s Priſon, I ſound a Tree-Frog; whereof I will ſpeak more at large hereafter; as alſo of a ſort of <hi>Arbutus,</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <hi>Comarea,</hi> with others at <hi>Athens.</hi>

            <p>Before we came to the <hi>Ionian</hi> Plains, we repented of our coming from <hi>Epheſus</hi> that day. For it began to be dark; and our <hi>Janizary,</hi> to avoid meeting Thieves, left the common Road, and led us ſuch a private way, that he at laſt loſt us in the Dark: and it began to thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, lighten, and rain, as if Heaven and Earth would diſſolve: And, at laſt, we were gotten into ſuch low Grounds, among the Moors, that we ſprang Ducks, and Snipes, and were in danger, every minute, to have our Horſes laid faſt. We lighted our Candle, and put it in a Lanthorn we carried with us; and looked up and down an hour or two for the way: but found it not. At laſt we came to a little Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock of dry Ground, covered with Buſhes; of which, with much ado, we made a Fire, and comforted our ſelves as well as we could, with a Bottle of <hi>Smyrna</hi> Wine. But we pitied our poor <hi>Janizary,</hi> that would drink no Wine with us; not had we any Water for him: Yet he bore the ill Accident with greater Patience, than is ordinary among ſuch People. We uſed all the Arguments we could, to perſwade him. My Comrade, as a Phyſician, adviſeth him; but all in vain. He ſaid, <hi>If he ſhould be ſick, God ſhould be his Phyſician.</hi> But this was not for fear of breaking his Law, as we underſtood afterwards; but by reaſon of a particular Vow he had made; which was upon this occaſion: He uſed always to have his Cellar well ſtored with the beſt Wine of the Country; of which he uſed to drink plentifully himſelf, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>Turks</hi> his Friends. But particularly once, Three of his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance came to ſee him; whom he reſolving to make merry, carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Cellar, to make choice of the Wine they liked beſt: Of which, when they grew merry, they began to talk of a pretty Young Maid in the Village: I of whom they diſcourſed, and drunk ſo long, till they became ſo valiant, at laſt, as to reſolve to go, and try her Vertue: which they executed, notwithſtanding all the Reſiſtance the Houſe could make, and brake into the Maid's Apartment: who reſiſting their fair Words, they began to uſe violence; which ſhe finding, ſuddenly ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:95495:97"/>a Ponyard from the ſide of one of them, and ſtabbed him to the Heart; which the reſt perceiving, fled. But the Maid, not yet ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for the Diſhonour done her, went, and complained to the <hi>Caddi;</hi> who finding it done in a drunken Fit, had the reſt well baſtinadoed. For this Diſgrace our <hi>Janizary</hi> went preſently to revenge himſelf on the poor Wine they had ſo abuſed; and knockt out all the heads of his Veſſels: making a ſolemn Vow, That he would never drink Wine more.</p>
            <p>Here we were alarm'd with the Noiſe of the <hi>Chacals,</hi> an Animal of the bigneſs of a <hi>Fox,</hi> which are here in great numbers. Once in an hour they would begin to howl; and as ſoon as one began, the whole Plain round about was filled with the Noiſe of them.</p>
            <p>Next Morning we went to <hi>Sedjaqui</hi> to dinner, which is a Village,<note place="margin">SEDJAQUI.</note> conſiſting of Merchants Country-Houſes, adorn'd with Gardens and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards; to which they come to take the freſh Air, and to courſe and hunt with their Grey-Hounds and Beagles; of which they always keep a good Pack. Here we were kindly entertain'd at D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Pickering</hi>'s Houſe, and return'd the ſame Evening to <hi>Smyrna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We had a great deſire to have ſeen many other Places in theſe Parts, eſpecially the reſt of the <hi>Seven Churches,</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Apocalypſe:</hi> But the time of the Year being paſt for ſuch Expeditions, the great Rains beginning to fall, and the Waters being up in moſt of the Plains, beſides other Riſques we were to expect; we contented our ſelves with the Information we received of the <hi>Conſul,</hi> and other ingenious Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants there, who had made thoſe Journeys, and very freely let us par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Pleaſure of their Travels, without the Pains.</p>
            <p>But pardon me, O Heavens! Do I call that <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> which is a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject fit only for a <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to lament over? He ſaw the <hi>Abomination</hi> of <hi>Deſolation,</hi> that was to come upon the Earth; and wiſhed, that his <hi>Eyes were Fountains of Tears, to weep day and night,</hi> the Deſtruction of the <hi>Daughter of Sion.</hi> With what ſatisfaction, or content, can I then invite you to come, and ſee, <hi>what Deſtruction the Lord hath</hi> here <hi>brought upon the Earth? But it is the Lord's doing:</hi> and thence we may reap no ſmall Advantage, by conſidering, how <hi>Just</hi> He is in all His <hi>Judgments,</hi> and <hi>Faithful</hi> in all His <hi>Promiſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider we then, what He, who has the <hi>ſharp Sword</hi> with <hi>two Edges,</hi> hath pronounced againſt the Church of <hi>Pergamus;</hi>
               <note place="margin">PERGAMUS.</note> viz. <hi>That He knew their Works, and where they dwelled;</hi> even where the <hi>Seat of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> is. He commends them for <hi>Holding faſt His Name,</hi> and not <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Faith,</hi> even when <hi>Antipas,</hi> His <hi>Faithful Martyr,</hi> was ſlain. But they had thoſe among them, that taught them to <hi>Eat things offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Idols,</hi> and to <hi>commit Fornication.</hi> They had thoſe, that held <hi>the Doctrine of the Nicolaites,</hi> hated by Him. Of all which he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them to repent: otherwiſe He would <hi>come quickly,</hi> and <hi>fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them with the Sword of His Mouth.</hi> This Church now is reduced to a very low condition. There is not in the whole Town above a dozen or fifteen Families of miſerable Chriſtians, that till the Ground to gain their Bread. They have but one Church left, dedicated to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Theodorus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Smyrna;</hi> under which Biſhoprick they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. Their own <hi>Cathedral Church,</hi> which was Fifty ſix Paces long,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:95495:98"/>and Thirty two broad, and ſtood in the heart of the City, is buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its own Ruins; their Angel, or Biſhop, remov'd; and its fair Pillars adorn the Graves, and rotten Carkaſſes of its Deſtroyers, the <hi>Turks;</hi> who are eſteemed about Two or three thouſand Souls in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Its other fine Church, called <hi>Santa Sophia,</hi> turned into a Moſque, and daily prophaned with the Blaſphemies of the Falſe Prophet. This Place yet preſerves its antient Name;<note place="margin">PERGAMO.</note> being now called <hi>Pergamo;</hi> and is ſituated in a fair and fruitful Plain, in Corn and Paſture, watered with the <hi>Cetius</hi> and <hi>Caicus.</hi> This paſſeth by it, within a Mile of it; and then they go together, to joyn with the <hi>Hermus.</hi> It lies on the South-ſide of a Mountain, that bounds the Plain on the North, and hath the rapid Stream <hi>Selinus,</hi> running by the City to the reſt of its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. It is a dozen Miles from the Sea, where it hath a Harbour; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fifteen Hours riding from <hi>Smyrna;</hi> and from <hi>Thyatira,</hi> almoſt North-Eaſt, a day and half's Journey. It was in times paſt adorned with a <hi>Theater,</hi> the Remains of it are yet to be ſeen, and a beautiful Palace, the Reſidence of their Kings, <hi>Attalus</hi> and <hi>Eumenes,</hi> often mentioned in the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory. It had a Caſtle on the top of the Hill, now neglected; where among ſome Ruins of Marble is a curious, antient Inſcription, dedicated by the Senate and People of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> to the Honour of <hi>Gaius Antius,</hi> &amp;c. who had been twice <hi>Conſul</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſul</hi> of <hi>Aſia,</hi> beſides many other Chief Offices of ſeveral particular Provinces of that, and other Places, as <hi>Candia</hi> and <hi>Cyprus,</hi> Eparch of <hi>Syria,</hi> under the Emperour <hi>Trajanus,</hi> and a great Benefactour to this Place, as followeth:

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:95495:98"/>writ
ΠΕΡΓΑΜΕΝΩΝ,
<hi>Of Pergamus.</hi> The Figure of which you may view, and proceed to conſider, how he that hath the <hi>Seven Spirits of God,</hi> and the <hi>Seven Stars,</hi> reproacheth them of <hi>Sardis.</hi> Apoc. 3.1, 2, &amp;c. <hi>I know thy Works. Thou hast a Name, that thou livest;</hi>
               <note place="margin">SARDIS.</note> 
               <hi>and art dead: Be watchful; and ſtrengthen the Things that remain, which are ready to die. For I have not found thy Works perfect before God. Remember therefore, how thou haſt received, and heard; and hold faſt, and repent. If therefore thou ſhalt not watch, I will come on thee as a Thief; and thou ſhalt not know, what Hour I come upon thee. Thou haſt a few Names even in</hi> Sardis, <hi>who have not defiled their Garments; and they ſhall walk with me in White; for they are worthy. He that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh, ſhall be cloathed in white Rayment; and I will not blot his Name out of the Book of Life; but will confeſs his Name before My Father, and before His Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now ſee, how it fareth with this miſerable Church, thus mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out by God; who being reduced to a very inconſiderable number, live by the Sweat of their Brows, in digging and planting the Gardens of the <hi>Turks</hi> they live amongſt, and ſerve; having neither Church nor Prieſt among them. Nor are the <hi>Turks</hi> themſelves there very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, either for Number or Riches; being only Herdſmen to the Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, feeding on thoſe ſpacious Plains, dwelling in a few pitiful Earthen Huts; having one Moſque, perverted to that uſe from a Chriſtian Church.</p>
            <p>Thus is that once Glorious City of the rich King <hi>Croeſus,</hi> now redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a Neſt of worſe than Beggars. Their <hi>Pactolus</hi> hath long ſince ceaſed to yield them Gold, and the Heavens to recover them their dying Glories. Yet there are ſome Remains of noble Structures, Remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of their proſperous State, long ſince deſtroyed. For at the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the City, are the Ruins of an old Caſtle, and of a great Church, and North, and South, Palaces, and other proud Buildings, humbled at preſent to the Earth.</p>
            <p>Some Inſcriptions I had given me of this Place, of which this is the moſt conſiderable; wherein the Council and Senate of <hi>Sardis,</hi> honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Emperour <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> as a Mark of their good Will.</p>

            <p>To conclude, It is ſituate about a days Journey South of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> at the Foot, and on the North-ſide of the famous Mountain <hi>Tmolus,</hi> called now by the <hi>Turks, Bozdag,</hi> or Joy-Mountain.

And that becauſe the Lord hath executed the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he hath ſpoken, upon her: That all the World might know, and tremble at the fierce Anger of God againſt impenitent, negligent, and careleſs Sinners.

Wherefore, becauſe they were <hi>neither Hot, nor Cold,</hi> they were loathſom to God; and He therefore aſſured them, He <hi>would ſpit them out of His Mouth.</hi> The Ruins ſhew it to have been a very great City, ſituate upon ſix or ſeven Hills, encompaſſing a large ſpace of Ground, twenty Miles diſtant from <hi>Coloſs,</hi> North-Eaſt, and five Miles South of <hi>Hierapolis;</hi> between which is a Plain, watered with the River <hi>Lycus,</hi> about a Mile and half diſtance from <hi>Laodicea.</hi> It hath three <hi>Theaters</hi> of white Marble, ſo beautiful and entire, as if they were but lately built; and a <hi>Circus</hi> as ſtately.

               <hi>Salter,</hi> and ſeveral other Merchants, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun <hi>June</hi> 23. 1673.</p>
            <p>The firſt day, after nine Hours riding, they came to a Village, called <hi>Chillema,</hi> South of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> not far from the Foot of the Mountain <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leman;</hi> and lodged that Night in their Tent, by a Fountain; but were much infeſted by Frogs and Flies. The next day, through a buſhy, rocky, and mountainous way, they came to the top of the <hi>Aleman;</hi> which I eſteem the Mountain <hi>Gallecius:</hi> Whence they had the Proſpect of the <hi>Epheſian</hi> Plains; and after twelve Hours riding the ſecond day, they came to <hi>Scala Nova,</hi> I ſuppoſe, after the <hi>Epheſian</hi> Plains; becauſe they ſpent ſo much time, going to it. It is a Garriſon Town, ſituate in the bottom of a Bay: moſt of the Inhabitants, out of Town, <hi>Greeks;</hi> the reſt <hi>Turks.</hi> There was formerly a Factory of <hi>French,</hi> ſetled there; but were removed to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> by order of the <hi>Sultaneſs Mother:</hi> ſo that now there is but ſmall Trade. I gueſs this to be the <hi>Neapolis, Strabo</hi> placeth hereabouts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> the third day of their Journey, they ſet out about four in the Morning; and about twelve came to a <hi>Greek</hi> Village, called <hi>Changlee,</hi> ſituate by the Sea-ſide, but almoſt ruined,<note place="margin">CHANGLEE olim PANIONIUM.</note> having no Defence againſt Pirats; who in the time of the <hi>Venetian</hi> War, ſo infeſted this Place, that now there remains only ſome few Houſes of very poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; who are ready to run away, at the ſight of every little Bark they ſee at Sea. They ſpent the Afternoon there, by reaſon of a very high Mountain they were to paſs the next day; at the Eoot of which this Village is ſituated; and reſted in a fair and pleaſant Garden, full of <hi>Oranges, Limons, Cherries,</hi> and ſeveral other ſorts of Fruits.

               <hi>Katherin.</hi> On the Wall of the firſt they found an Inſcription, where <hi>Amyntor,</hi> when he was <hi>Prytane,</hi> or Chief Magiſtrate among them, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,

            <p>Whence, I judge, the antient Name of this Place was <hi>Panionium.</hi> That which confirms me in this opinion, is the Situation <hi>Strabo</hi> gives to the <hi>Panionium,</hi> on this ſide of the Mountain <hi>Mycale,</hi> about a quarter of a Mile from the Sea: For ſo is the Situation of <hi>Changlee.</hi> This <hi>Panionion</hi> was the Place, where all theſe thirteen Cities of <hi>Ionia</hi> met, to conſult a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their common Affairs.</p>
            <p>The next day, about four in the Morning, they ſet out; and having gained the top of the Mountain <hi>Mycale,</hi> with ſome difficulty, although it be pleaſant by reaſon of the cool Shades, made by ſeveral ſorts of Trees, as <hi>Cheſnut</hi>-Trees, and very tall <hi>Pines,</hi> and freſh Springs, iſſuing plentifully out of the ſides of it, they had very large Proſpects about them, North and Weſt-wards <hi>Ionia,</hi> and the <hi>Ionian</hi> Sea, towards the South, the Plains of <hi>Caria,</hi> to the Mountain <hi>Latmus,</hi> with the curious Windings and Turnings of the River <hi>Meander;</hi> which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Salter,</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Merchant of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> deſigned, and among other Draughts obliged me with a Copy of this. The Deſcent was very difficult; the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain being nothing but a Rock of very clear Marble, altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed by Trees. But in two Hours time they came into the Plain, through a narrow way, having left behind them the Remains of a Caſtle Eaſt-ward.</p>
            <p>At the Foot of this Hill is a Village, called <hi>Sanſon;</hi> where are ſome Ruins, and a Pillar, with a defaced Inſcription they could not take. This, or the Old Caſtle, by <hi>Strabo</hi>'s Deſcription, ſhould be <hi>Prienia. For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>coming from</hi> Miletium, <hi>beyond the Mouth of the</hi> Meander, <hi>s the</hi> Prienian <hi>Shore; and above</hi> Prienia, <hi>the Mountain</hi> Mycale, <hi>well wooded, and furniſhed with Game.</hi> Thence, after travelling through a large Plain, they came to the River <hi>Meander,</hi> called now by the <hi>Turks Bojuc-minder,</hi> or the <hi>Great Meander,</hi> in oppoſition to that at <hi>Epheſus;</hi> which they call the <hi>Little Meander.</hi> They paſſed it by a Ferry; it being about ſixteen Fathoms over, and in the middle as deep; as the Ferry-Men informed them: and the Current is very ſwift.</p>

            <p>They were after carried to the Ruins of an old <hi>Greek Church,</hi> as the People ſay it hath been: under which is a very fair arched Place; where the People now ſalt their Fiſh, after they have taken out the Rows, whereof they make <hi>Botargoes:</hi> the moſt they catch being very large <hi>Mullets.</hi> Upon this arched Place is a Foundation of very fair Marble, of divers colours. But the Superſtructures of the Wall ſeem to be more modern, being of ſeveral ſorts of Stone, compiled in a confuſed manner: among which they found one Stone, with an Inſcription; whereon is
ΠΟΛΙΣ ΜΙΛΗΣΙΩΝ,
<hi>The City of the Mileſians,</hi> five times repeated; which would effectually prove <hi>Miletum</hi> to be the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Name of the Place, if the Deſcription that <hi>Strabo</hi> gives of the Situation of <hi>Miletum</hi> did better agree with our Account of this Place. For <hi>Strabo</hi> puts Mount <hi>Latmus,</hi> a Bay of the ſame Name, and two other Towns, between <hi>Miletum,</hi> and the Mouth of the <hi>Meander;</hi> to wit, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclea</hi> and <hi>Pyrrha;</hi> telling, <hi>Meander</hi> from <hi>Pyrrha,</hi> was fifty <hi>Stadia;</hi> that is, betwixt ſix and ſeven Miles; and from thence to <hi>Heraclea,</hi> fifty <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia;</hi> and ſailing by the Shore, a little more to <hi>Miletum,</hi> but in a right Line, only thirty <hi>Stadia;</hi> that is, about four Miles: whereas our Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers put this <hi>Palatſha,</hi> but at <hi>two Hours riding,</hi> after they had paſt the <hi>Meander.</hi> But, perhaps, the Place of the Ferry, whereby they paſt the <hi>Meander,</hi> was nearer to <hi>Palatſha,</hi> than it was to the Mouth of the River; of which only <hi>Strabo</hi> ſpeaks. The vaſt Ruins indeed here, and Inſcriptions, ſeem worthily to prove, That this was the <hi>Miletum,</hi> one of the Twelve Cities of <hi>Ionia,</hi> formerly as famous as <hi>Epheſus,</hi> though now reduced to the ſame Fate, having only ſome Cottages of Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds. But the little River <hi>Latmus,</hi> or <hi>Lamus,</hi> or <hi>Lycus,</hi> according to <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy,</hi> near which this Place is, and the Wetneſs of the Ground, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>Strabo,</hi> ſeem to be againſt us; and to call it antiently by
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:95495:103"/>the Name of <hi>Pyrrha.</hi> And here <hi>Strabo</hi> thinks, he ſheweth his Art in Geography very much: So that it is too hard a matter for me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the queſtion between <hi>Strabo,</hi> and the Inſcription. This In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription is a kind of <hi>Taliſman,</hi> or Charm of the Antient Hereticks, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Baſilidiani,</hi> or <hi>Gnoſticks;</hi> who fanſied great vertue to be contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the word, <hi>Jehovah;</hi> which they expreſſed by the ſeven <hi>Greek</hi> Vowels, ΑΕΗΙΟΥΩ,
tranſpoſing them into great variety of Changes; as appears in this Inſcription ten times. The word
ΑΓΙΕ,
which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, makes it manifeſt; whereby each Column may be interpreted after this manner: <hi>Holy Jehovah, preſerve this Town of the</hi> Mileſians, <hi>and all its Inhabitants;</hi> as alſo, that which is written underneath, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying this: <hi>O Arch-angels, let the City of the</hi> Mileſians <hi>be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved!</hi>

            <p>About five in the Afternoon they parted from <hi>Palatſha,</hi> and about two hours after came to a <hi>Greek</hi> Village, where they lay; from whence two hours more in the Morning, brought them to the bottom of a Bay, which they call the <hi>Gulph of Samos;</hi> perhaps formerly <hi>Latmicus Sinus:</hi> going on ſtill by the Sea-ſide, they found the Ruins of a vaſt Structure, called by the <hi>Turks, Jotan.</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Pickering</hi> was of opinion,<note place="margin">JOTAN.</note> That it was the Sepulcher of <hi>Mauſolus,</hi> built by <hi>Artemiſia</hi> to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of her Husband at <hi>Halicarnaſſus,</hi> and one of the Seven Wonders of the World. For it is yet moſt ſplendid in its vaſt Ruins, built of white Marble, and adorned with Pillars of all Orders; of which two only were entire of the <hi>Ionick</hi> Order, with an Architrave on them. But I believe the Doctor was ſhort a great way, in his Conjecture of that <hi>Mauſolum,</hi> as will appear further. I ſuppoſe it to be only the Ruins
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:95495:104"/>of ſome <hi>Theater,</hi> by the Draught they gave me of it. But upon better Examination, I rather believe it to have been the Temple and Oracle of <hi>Didymeus Apollo</hi> at <hi>Branchida;</hi> which being burnt by <hi>Xerxes,</hi> as all the reſt beſides the <hi>Epheſium,</hi> the <hi>Mileſians</hi> again rebuilt it the biggeſt of all others, letting it remain uncovered by reaſon of its vaſt Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for it was as big as a Town in circumference, having a moſt excellent Grove within and without. This was eighteen <hi>Stadia</hi> from <hi>Poſidium prom.</hi> of the <hi>Mileſians,</hi> and not far either by Land or Sea to the City, meaning <hi>Miletum;</hi> which he next falls a deſcribing by name: Then follows <hi>Latmicus Sinus,</hi> and therein <hi>Heraclea,</hi> under the Mountain <hi>Latmus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thence, from ſeven in the Morning until five Afternoon, they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over a very bad Mountainous way: whence may be learnt, if compared with <hi>Strabo,</hi> that that Mountain is the <hi>Latmus</hi> of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; and if ſo, the Bay above-mentioned muſt, as I ſaid, be <hi>Sinus Latmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus:</hi> which if true, that place of Ruins, called now <hi>Jotan,</hi> ſhould be <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclea,</hi> called before that time <hi>Latmus,</hi> from the Mountain about it: which if ſo, that which my Companion hath judged to be <hi>Maletum,</hi> will be no other than <hi>Pyrrha;</hi> or <hi>Strabo</hi> hath not acquitted himſelf ſo well as he pretended to do: So that we ſhall be yet to ſeek for <hi>Miletum;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Place, where they reſted this Morning, or ſome where there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, was it: For here were Ruins alſo, and ſome Inſcriptions among them.</p>
            <p>Near a Fountain where they lodged was one, which they deſcrib'd to be a Stone, hollowed by the People to beat Corn in; and is carved on one ſide with a Man on Horſeback, and a Serpent under the Horſe Feet; having on the other ſide an Inſcription, not ſo well copied, that I can make any thing of it. Monſieur <hi>Spon</hi> thinks the Perſon, for whoſe Monument it was erected, was of <hi>Miletum;</hi> for there is
.. ΕΙΛΗ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ΣΙΟΣ,

the Μ. being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neglected by the Copiſt, or defaced by time. But they relate no ſuch great Matters of the Place, as that it ſhould be equal with <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and thought one of the two beſt Cities of <hi>Ionia.</hi> But perhaps our Travellers might not ſee all the Ruins; or it may be, the greateſt part, and beſt of them, are by the various and potent Engines of Time, and Fate, now no more to be ſeen. Yet although this Place ſeems to have loſt it ſelf, and we are ſo uncertain where to find it, it was, in antient times, a Place of great Renown, both for the many Colonies they planted abroad; and alſo for the Birth of many <hi>Worthies,</hi> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Thales,</hi>

            <p>They reſted <hi>Sunday,</hi> until ſix in the Evening: Then taking Horſe, in three Hours time they paſt over a Mountain, and came to a Place in the open Field, where was a Fountain, or Spring of freſh Water; at which they reſted till Morning, within ſight of the Sea.</p>

            <p>At a Point, about a Stones-caſt from the City, in the Sea, are the Ruins of a ſmall Caſtle: It is now quite diſ-inhabited; nor hath any Town or Village near it.</p>

            <p>The Land about it, by their Draught of it, ſeems to be rocky, and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Ground.

            </p>
            <p>This alſo agreeth with the Information, that one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>William Michel</hi> gave me; who ſhewed me a large Map of the Coaſts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> made by his own, and others Obſervations: where over againſt the Iſland <hi>Coos,</hi> is drawn a large Bay, and the Ruins of a Town upon each Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory: But thoſe upon the Southern Promontory were exceeding great, as he was informed by a Bey of a Galley, who found them, and told him, That thoſe to the South were called <hi>Okanſtenches;</hi> and the North-moſt, <hi>Boundron:</hi> but are both only heaps of Ruins, and both uninhabited. Of theſe the Southern-moſt ſhould be <hi>Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnaſſus;</hi> which was the Native Place of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> the moſt antient <hi>Grecian</hi> Hiſtorian remaining among us; as alſo of <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> ſir-named from this Place, <hi>Halicarnaſſaeus.</hi> And this is all the News I learned ſo far South.</p>
            <p>Our Travellers went no farther than <hi>Askemkaleſi;</hi> but returned ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, more within the Continent, as followeth. Parting from <hi>Askem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaleſi,</hi> about five in the Evening, they traverſed a pleaſant Mountain; which, after ſome hours Riding, brought them into a large Plain, with a fair River running in it, with many turnings, and windings, like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Meander;</hi> which paſſing over by a Stone-Bridge, they came to certain <hi>Turkiſh Cottages,</hi> where they ſtaid till two in the Morning only; apprehending they were among Thieves, and willing to be on their way before them: wherein, through God's Mercy, they had their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire fulfill'd, arriving at a more ſecure Place, called <hi>Melaſſo,</hi> about ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the ſame Morning.</p>
            <p>In this Place they ſaw ſeveral remarkable Pieces of Antiquity; which together with the preſent Name, not much corrupted from the antient,<note place="margin">MELASSO olim MYLASA.</note> aſſureth, That this Place was formerly called <hi>Mylaſa,</hi> and not <hi>Miletum,</hi> as our Modern Geographers think, being deceiv'd by the likeneſs of the Name, and not knowing the Situation. The firſt Antiquity was a fair Temple of Marble, with an Inſcription on the Front, ſhewing it was built in Honour of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> and to the Goodeſs of <hi>Rome.</hi>

After which he returned, and began to frequent the Courts of <hi>Juſtice;</hi> where quickly he got himſelf ſuch a Reputation, that even while <hi>Euthydemus</hi> was yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, he was greatly admired; and ſoon after his Death, rendred himſelf Maſter of the City. But <hi>Euthydemus,</hi> whilſt he lived, was both powerful, and uſeful to the City: and although his way of handling the Town ſeemed ſomething Tyrannical; yet he balanced that with the Benefits he did them. Which gave <hi>Hybreas</hi> one day occaſion, at the end of his Speech, to give him a bold Reproof; but much to the purpoſe: <hi>Thou art a neceſſary Evil,</hi> ſaid he; <hi>for we can neither live with thee, nor without thee.</hi>

            <p>About half a Mile out of this Town, there is a ſquare Temple, with four Pillars on every ſide: It is built upon an Arch, and covered on the top with many large Stones, laid one upon another. The Figure I had given me of it, is This. My Comrade eſteems it to one of the Temples of <hi>Jupiter, Strabo</hi> ſpeaks of. But ſurely not that, which he ſays was ſixty <hi>Stadia</hi> out of Town; for that is in effect eight Miles; and the other was in the Town, called <hi>Oſogo.</hi> Near the Pillar of <hi>Menan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>

            <p>No City, in <hi>Strabo</hi>'s time, was more curiouſly adorn'd with <hi>Porticoe's</hi> and Temples, than this, having a Quarry of moſt excellent white Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in the Mountains above them; of which Glory you have heard what remains to be ſeen at preſent: The reſt is buried in its Ruins.

            <p>The next day they paſt over another very high Mountain, eſteem'd, by their Report, the higheſt of all <hi>Caria;</hi> and which, according to their deſign of <hi>Viſiting the Churches,</hi> I believe, muſt be Mount <hi>Latmus</hi> again, and the ſame which, <hi>Strabo</hi> ſaith, <hi>Mylaſſa</hi> was built under.

               <hi>Strabo</hi> ſaith, was a Colony of <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and had two Temples near it in theſe Plains; the moſt beautiful of them dedicated to <hi>Hecate,</hi> and the other to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Chryſaorius:</hi> which was common to all the <hi>Carians,</hi> being the Place where they uſed to meet, to ſacrifice, and confer on Matters of State: which Aſſembly of theirs was called <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaorium.</hi> That which confirms me in this Opinion, is, That <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Tables place <hi>Stratonicaea</hi> this way from <hi>Mylaſſa;</hi> not that the diſtances do exactly agree: I think it may ſuffice, that they do agree as well as other diſtances, his Tables commonly aſſigne.

But this hath only

in the Inſcription, without any other Addition; and therefore ought to be referred to the <hi>Magneſia</hi> on the <hi>Meander;</hi> of which <hi>Strabo</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his Fourteenth Book, calling it <hi>Magneſia</hi>

For in the next Page he ſaith, <hi>From</hi> Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſia <hi>in the way to</hi> Trallis, <hi>the Mountain</hi> Meſogis <hi>is on the left hand, and the Plain of</hi> Meander <hi>on the right, inhabited by the Lydians, the Carians, Ionians, Myleſſians, Myſians, and the Aeolians by</hi> Magneſia.

ΕΠΙ ΑΥΡ. ΠΡΙΜΟΥ ΡΟΥΦΙΝΟΥ ΝΥϹΕΩΝ;
ſignifying that it was of this City, <hi>Nyſa,</hi> coined under the Governour <hi>Aurelius, Primus, Ruphinus.</hi> Of <hi>Nyſa, Strabo</hi> informeth us, That it was on the Brow of the Hill <hi>Meſogis,</hi> and divided, as it were, into two Parts by a Vally, with a Torrent running between: That it had the Plain of the <hi>Meander</hi> towards the South of it, like <hi>Trallis;</hi> ſituate

ΑΝΤΙΟΧΕΩΝ ΜΗΤΡΟΚΟΛΩΝ,
<hi>Of Antioch</hi>—. But the laſt word I know not how to interpret. I have viewed narrowly, to find, whether it is not <hi>Metropolωn;</hi> which <hi>Suidas</hi> interprets the Title of a City, which hath ſent Colonies, or Plantations, as the Mother of other Cities. But the K. is plain in one of them, and in the other ſeemeth not to be a Π. <hi>Strabo</hi> mentions a Lake, five or ſix Miles from <hi>Sardis,</hi> called in his time
ΚΟΛΟΝ; but in <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Ogygia;</hi> where there was a Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> much celebrated. Whether this might not be a Colony of <hi>Antioch</hi> upon the <hi>Meander,</hi> whence they of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi> aſſum'd the Title of
ΜΗΤΡΟΚΟΛΟΝS,
is a conjecture; but of no great weight, I confeſs. Of this <hi>Antiochia</hi> I have no other thing to ſay, than what <hi>Strabo</hi> long ſince remarked; which is, That it was built on both ſides of that Part of the <hi>Meander,</hi> which is towards <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> in a very fruitful Soil.</p>

               </note> becauſe I have ſeen it in none of the Cabinets, or Collections of Medals, any where. It is one of thoſe ſorts, that the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Madalioni;</hi> the <hi>French, Medalion:</hi> being larger, and of more accurate Work, than the ordinary Medals: which Medaliſts divide either into Silver, or little, middle, or great Braſs. Beſides, in them is the Head and Shoulders ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; which is not ordinary in others. This is of Braſs, with the Buſt of the Emperour <hi>Valerianus,</hi> crowned with a radiant Crown, and the Drapery on his Shoulders, and the whole Work admirably well exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in a high <hi>Relievo;</hi> and his Name expreſſed in theſe Letters,

On the Reverſe is a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or Altar, ſuſtain'd by two <hi>Lyons,</hi> and Palm-Trees in the middle. On the top are placed two Urns, with Palm-Branches iſſuing out of them. On the firſt are Letters illegible; on the other may be read,

ΚΥΜΑΙΩΝ.
Of this Name there was a Plain on the <hi>Hermus</hi> in <hi>Aeolis,</hi> and a City called <hi>Cumaea,</hi> between <hi>Myrina</hi> and <hi>Phacaea:</hi> But whether it were where <hi>Foia Nova</hi> is, may be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe it is too near <hi>Foia Vecchia;</hi> which was undoubtedly <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caea.</hi> I therefore leave it to be decided, by thoſe that ſhall from <hi>Smyrna</hi> have the Curioſity to examine it.</p>
            <p>Of <hi>Samos</hi> I ſaw, and have my ſelf a conſiderable number, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be found there not long before our coming to <hi>Sniyrna;</hi> of which theſe are the moſt confiderable Reverſes.</p>
            <p>The firſt I ſhall deſcribe,<note place="margin">Med. <hi>99.</hi>
               </note> is the Reverſe of the Emperour <hi>Philip,</hi> which hath on it a ſtanding Figure of a Woman, with a Crown upon her Head, like that of <hi>Serapis,</hi> with her Arms ſpread abroad; from whence hang long Bracelets equal with her Veſtments down to the Ground. This is judged to repreſent <hi>Juno</hi> of <hi>Samos,</hi> who was the Goddeſs chiefly
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:95495:109"/>adored by thoſe of that Iſland; and was ſuppoſed by them to be born there. She had a very antient, and famous Temple there, and as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient an Image; being the Work of one <hi>Smilis</hi> of <hi>Aegina,</hi> Son of <hi>Euclides,</hi> Cotemporary with <hi>Daedalus,</hi> as <hi>Pauſanias</hi> reports, though not ſo famous: Yet, he ſaith, ſome ſay, The Temple was dedicated by the <hi>Argonauts;</hi> and the Image alſo brought from thence by them, which the <hi>Samians</hi> will by no means allow: Her Temple was ſituated by the River <hi>Imbraſus;</hi> which, as <hi>Strabo</hi> informs us, was at the left hand, entring into the Harbour in the Suburbs of the City; and is the ſame I find repreſented on the Reverſe of another Medal I have of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Trajanus Decius,</hi> by a Cumbent Figure, near a Spring running by her, and out of a Pitcher beyond her;<note place="margin">Med. <hi>100.</hi>

            <p>The next is the Reverſe of two Medals I have;<note place="margin">Med. <hi>102.</hi>
               </note> the one of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Caracalla,</hi> and the other of the Empreſs <hi>Julia Mammaa.</hi> And thereon <hi>Juno</hi> is again made to repreſent <hi>Serapis,</hi> by the Crown on her Head; but <hi>Fortune,</hi> by the Rudder ſhe holds in her right hand; and <hi>Plenty,</hi> by her Cornucopia in the left: Which puts me in mind of a Curioſity I ſaw at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the curious Study of Signior <hi>Belaurio,</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquary to the late Cardinal <hi>de Maſſimo;</hi> who, with great Courteſie, gave me the Liberty to have it deſigned. It is a ſmall Statue of Braſs, made to repreſent all the Gods, called by the Heathens, <hi>Pantheon.</hi> By the Crown on its Head, it repreſents <hi>Serapis;</hi> which being adorned
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:95495:110"/>with the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> repreſents <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Diana.</hi> The beautiful Face repreſents <hi>Venus;</hi> and wearing a Diadem, and a Basket upon it, <hi>Juno</hi> and <hi>Ceres;</hi> her Wings and Quiver are for <hi>Cupid;</hi> her Lyon's Skin on her Shoulder, is for <hi>Hercules;</hi> her Cornucopia in the right hand, makes her the Goddeſs of <hi>Plenty;</hi> out of which alſo appears two Heads of Youth and Age, perhaps to repreſent <hi>Hebe</hi> and <hi>Saturn:</hi> Her left hand is twiſted about with a Serpent, to repreſent <hi>Aeſculapius;</hi> with a ſacrificing Diſh in her hands, to repreſent <hi>Veſta,</hi> or the <hi>Mother of the Gods;</hi> and a Rudder, to repreſent <hi>Fortune,</hi> as this of my Medal doth. And, perhaps, the <hi>Samians,</hi> in the time of <hi>Caracalla,</hi> did ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent their <hi>Juno;</hi> under the notion of whom, they both repreſented, and worſhipped all other the Gods of the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> And I ſaw alſo at <hi>Rome,</hi> at the Palace <hi>Matheo,</hi> a <hi>Baſſo-relievo</hi> on Marble, for the ſame purpoſe; but repreſented in another Form, which would be too long a Digreſſion here to deſcribe. But it would be Argument enough to me, did not ſeveral of the Heathen Authors aſſure the ſame thing, That they never were ſo ſtupid, as to believe their Images really Gods; but only Signs, or Repreſentations to honour them by, whom they believed were above. So that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, in vain, excuſe their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Images, by telling, They are not ſo ſtupid, as to believe, that their Statues and Pictures are really God, or their Saints; and that they make them, only to honour them; uſe them, only to put them in mind of them in Heaven: when, upon due Examination, the Heathens will be found to have done juſt the ſame thing; and excuſe themſelves as well, as to the making of Images, and worſhipping them in honour of their Gods; ſeeing they believed their Idols to be only honorary Repreſentations of them, and not their Deities indeed. And ſo the Modern <hi>Romans</hi> will be found as great Breakers of the <hi>Second Commandment,</hi> as their Anceſtors were of both <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Second;</hi> this Commandment generally forbidding making all manner of Images, and Repreſentations, as mediate Objects of Worſhip and Devotion, as the other forbids all other immediate Objects of Worſhip, beſides the One, only true God: Upon which account alſo, no doubt, they are defective. But it is not my buſineſs to upbraid them; much rather, it is my Prayers, That they would open their Eyes, and ſee the great Light now ſhining amongſt us.</p>
            <p>Of <hi>Philipe</hi> I have another,<note place="margin">Med. <hi>103.</hi>
               </note> whoſe Reverſe is a ſtanding Figure in a <hi>Roman</hi> Habit; I ſuppoſe, repreſenting the Emperour, with <hi>Juno</hi>'s Buckler in his right hand, undoubtedly to ſignify his Soveraignty over <hi>Samos;</hi> and a Palm-Branch in the other, to ſhew ſome Conqueſt, and very likely, over them, after ſome Rebellion. And this to me ſeems al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to be repreſented on the Reverſe of the next Medal, I have of the Empreſs <hi>Tranquillina,</hi> the Wife of the Precedent Emperour <hi>Gordianus Pius:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Med. <hi>104.</hi>

How, and what the Matter was, is uncertain, Hiſtory being ſilent herein: But ſome Victory over them is clearly indicated, by the following Medals; eſpecially this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalion of <hi>Macrinus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Med. <hi>105.</hi>
               </note> whoſe Reverſe hath the Emperour holding <hi>Juno</hi>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:95495:110"/>of <hi>Samos</hi> with the right hand, who ſtands in the Melancholy Poſture of folding her Arms; and a Spear in the left; and a Victory crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him at the ſame hand, with theſe Letters,
ΣΑΜΙΩΝ,
about it; to ſignify his Conqueſt even over <hi>Juno</hi> of <hi>Samos,</hi> the Protectoreſs of that Iſland, who had not Deity enough to reſcue them out of his hand.</p>
            <p>The next is alſo of <hi>Macrinus.</hi> The Reverſe is <hi>Hercules,</hi>

            <p>The Ships we had ſo long attended, for our Paſſage on to <hi>Zant,</hi> were the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and the <hi>Dartmouth</hi> Frigats: Of the firſt S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Roger Strickland</hi> was then Captain, and carried the Flag as Convoy to the <hi>London-Merchant;</hi> and the <hi>Owen</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> who being laded at <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> were bound for <hi>London.</hi> S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>John Temple</hi> was Captain of the <hi>Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth;</hi> who with great Civility received us aboard on his Ship, and gave us the beſt Accommodation in it that he could; making me his titular Lieutenant, for want of his real one, whom he left ſick in <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> the ſeventeenth of <hi>November,</hi> we went on Board; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpent in taking leave of our Friends, who moſt obligingly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied us, the next Morning, by three of the Clock, we hoiſted ſail, having a fair and gentle Gale to bring us out of the Bay. From the Caſtle the Chanel is made narrow by the Sands on the North-ſide: But I obſerved, we ſteered as near the Southern Shore, as poſſible; and doing ſo, there is no danger. We left <hi>Foia Vechia</hi> on the right hand in ſight, and <hi>Vourla</hi> on the left, upon the <hi>Cape,</hi> called by the <hi>Turks, Calabouroun,</hi> and by the Engliſh, <hi>Cape Giobernole;</hi> but antient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was call'd <hi>Argennum.</hi> Between This, and the oppoſite Shore, are two little Iſlands, at the Mouth of the Bay. After we were out, we paſſed along the Shore of thoſe high Mountains, called <hi>The Brothers,</hi> and in the Evening had the <hi>Aleman</hi> againſt us more South. But the next day the Wind turning South-Weſt, and continuing ſo for two days, we could make no way; only boarding between the Iſle <hi>Scio</hi> and <hi>Pſara,</hi> till the Twenty firſt day; when, with much ado, we doubled <hi>Pſara;</hi> and having now more Sea room, we came in ſight of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:95495:111"/>
               <hi>Negropont.</hi> But the next Bord, the Wind blowing extream hard, ſet us back again by the next day within <hi>Pſara. Wedneſday</hi> the Twenty third, was ſpent in a very great Storm: For about ten a clock on <hi>Tueſday</hi> night, from the high Mountains of <hi>Scio</hi> were poured down ſuch furious Blaſts of Wind, accompanied with ſuch prodigious Thunder and Lightning, as was ready every Moment to over-ſet the Ship, break the Maſts, and rent the Sails, before they could furl them. The Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were all in a confuſion, and could not agree what to do; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to lowre the main Sail, or to furl it, or let it alone as it was. But at laſt they concluded to let it alone, and luff as near the Wind as they could; and ſo let her drive. It laſted not in this extremity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove an hour and half, or two hours; but blew very hard all Night, and the next day: But on <hi>Thurſday</hi> Morning it was calm. In this Storm we broke the <hi>Whip-ſtock,</hi> and ſplit the <hi>Stem</hi> down to the <hi>Rudder:</hi> But the Carpenter ſoon bound it about with Iron Hoops he had ready for ſuch Accidents. It fared not much better with the Merchants, and other Ships; moſt of them having rent their Sails: But ours being the leaſt, it was more toſſed than they. So ſoon as it was calm, the reſt of the Captains went on Board the <hi>Dragon,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult what ſhould be done in caſe of a Separation, if the Storm ſhould return. They all concluded, That if the Separation was made by a South-Wind, they ſhould meet at <hi>Tenedos;</hi> if by a North, then at <hi>Milo.</hi> After this ſeveral days we ſpent, tacking to and fro, not being able to make any way; until <hi>Monday</hi> the Twenty eighth, the Wind came to the North-Eaſt Point, and brought us to the Paſſage between the Iſlands <hi>Andros</hi> and <hi>Negropont.</hi> But growing very high near Night, they durſt not venture among the Iſlands in the dark; eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of a low Rock in this Paſſage, which might have proved Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. They reſolved therefore to bord it till Morning; when we found our ſelves over againſt the Paſſage between <hi>Micone</hi> and <hi>Tine,</hi> with the Wind fair to paſs. But the Merchant-men were ſo far behind, and being deep laden, ſo ſlow, that we were forced to lowre our Top-ſail to ſtay for them, and ſo were becalmed within two Leagues of the Paſſage. Some hours after, the Wind roſe contrary; but at night it changed again, and brought a moſt furious North-Wind, that drove the Waters into ſuch Heaps, as made them ſeem, as if the Rocky Iſlands of thoſe Seas had broke looſe. We rent the Mizen-ſail from top to bottom, and endangered both the Main-ſail and Maſt; and not a Sail left, but was forc'd the next day to be changed. The Wind abated nothing of its force, nor the Sea of its raging, making the Veſſel often heel; ſo that the Water would ſometimes come over the Lee-board. We lay as cloſe to the Wind Eaſt-wards, as poſſible, to avoid the Shores of <hi>Micone,</hi> and <hi>Tine,</hi> as I ſaid; and found our ſelves this Morning drove ſixty Miles near <hi>Nicaria;</hi> where the Shipwrack of <hi>Icarus</hi> gave name to thoſe Seas about it, and was no good <hi>Omen</hi> to us in ſuch extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Weather. This Morning alſo we miſs'd one of our Ships; and could not imagine what Fate it had ſuffered, ſince it had fared ſo badly with us. Nor was it then time to ſtay, and make ſearch: but we paſſed on South-Eaſtwards; and beyond <hi>Nicaria,</hi> we diſcerned <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> North-Eaſt of us: and that day, with Wind in poop, and Waves
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:95495:111"/>often above it, we made near an hundred Miles. In the Evening we ſaw <hi>Stampalia,</hi> which we left at our right hand; and in the Night, with only the Main-ſail, we made as far as <hi>Scarpanto;</hi> which is an Iſle of near fifty Miles about, conſiſting of Hills and Mountains not unfruitful. They ſaid, We ſaw <hi>Rhodes;</hi> and we reſolved to go round about <hi>Candia;</hi> where I often wiſhed my ſelf on ſhore, to ſee that Place ſo famous for curious Plants: whoſe high Mountains where they grow, we often diſcerned. And then we were paſt the greateſt danger, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Sea-room enough; and both Sea and Winds growing more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, we again recovered our Spirits, and were glad that God had ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered us.</p>
            <p>But we made it ſeventeen or eighteen days more, in all Thirty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven days, before we arrived at <hi>Zant</hi> from <hi>Smyrna;</hi> which was on <hi>Chriſtmas-Eve,</hi> or the Twenty fourth of <hi>December,</hi> (old Style) which the <hi>Greeks</hi> yet continue to obſerve, as well as the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Here alſo we found the <hi>Owen</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> which we feared had made ſhipwrack the Night ſhe was ſeparated from us: But, by God's help, ſhe paſſed well between the Iſlands, and arrived hither fifteen days before us. So we all at laſt came ſafe to our deſired Port, and welcomed one another, giving God the Praiſe; as it is moſt juſt we ſhould, for the ſafety of each moment his good Providence ſecureth to us: But more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, for ſuch eminent and extraordinary Deliverances; for we truly had ſeen God's Wonders in the Deep, and had experience of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy towards thoſe, that go down to the Sea in Ships, employing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the great Water-flouds. Then had we great reaſon to call to mind <hi>Holy David</hi>'s admirable Deſcription of a Storm, we had in each point ſo dreadfully experimented: How could we then forbear taking his Advice, and give Him the Praiſe, who ſo graciouſly was pleaſed to deliver us from thoſe Terrours of Death encompaſſing of us round about. And how could we more acceptably expreſs our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, than by that Sacred Hymn he had inſpired the beſt of Poets, as well as Kings, with; part of which I have endeavoured, in our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, thus to Paraphraſe:
<q>
                  <l>O that Mankind would praiſe the Lord, and ſhow</l>
                  <l>His Wonders done for Mortals here below!</l>

                  <l>Who though I want fit Words, want not a Heart.</l>
                  <l>From the ſafe Port, whom gentle Gales invite</l>

                  <l>Theſe (ſurely) learn, who 'tis their Souls doth keep.</l>
                  <l>When on the ſmootheſt Calm the Heavens frown,</l>

                  <l>No Mortal Pow'r their Fury can aſſwage.</l>
                  <l>They foam and roar; they toſs the Ships ſo high,</l>

                  <l>Their Wits quite gone, their Reaſon from them fled;</l>
                  <l>They look upon themſelves already dead.</l>
                  <l>Then cry they to the Lord in their diſtreſs;</l>

            <p>SO ſoon as we had kept our Chriſtmas a Ship-board with our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, not being permitted to do it a Shore, coming from thoſe Parts of <hi>Turky</hi> ſuſpected of Contagion; we hired a good Barque, with a <hi>Greek</hi> that could ſpeak <hi>Italian,</hi> and a little <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to ſerve us; and notwithſtanding we had once been turned back by contrary Winds the day before, yet <hi>December</hi> 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> we paſſed over to <hi>Caſtle-Torneſe;</hi>
               <note place="margin">CASTLE-TORNESE.</note> being about eighteen or twenty Miles to the neareſt Shore of <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> now called <hi>Morea.</hi> The Caſtle is upon a Hill, half a dozen Miles from the Shore: But we went forward, and turned the Promontory <hi>Chelonitis</hi> between it and a <hi>Scoglio,</hi> called <hi>Cacolidida,</hi> with Shallows about it, and by ten in the Morning made thirty Miles, from <hi>Zant</hi> to <hi>Chiarenza,</hi> a ruined City, formerly belonging to the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians.</hi> There are ſuch vaſt Maſſes of Wall turned upſide down, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

The Situation,<note place="margin">CHIARENZA olim CYLLENE.</note> and thoſe Marks of Antiquity aſſured us, That this was the antient City <hi>Cyllene,</hi> the Country of <hi>Mercury;</hi> from whence he was ſirnamed <hi>Cyl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Greek-Monks.</hi> About ſix Miles South-Eaſt of <hi>Caſtle-Torneſe,</hi> is a Town the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Clemouzzi:</hi>
               <note place="margin">CLEMOUZ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZY. GASTOUNI.</note> About ſixteen from thence alſo, is another indifferent large Town, called <hi>Gaſtouni;</hi> which is about five Miles from the Sea, and on a River, which, perhaps, was the River <hi>Penea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thence continuing along the Coaſts of the <hi>Morea</hi> twenty Miles fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we came to <hi>Cotichi;</hi>
               <note place="margin">COTICHI.</note> where there is a Fiſhing Place, called <hi>Peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charia:</hi> which is a Lake fed and ſtored by the Sea; where in <hi>July</hi> they catch abundance of <hi>Mullets,</hi> to make <hi>Botargus,</hi> and Salt-Fiſh. There is ſuch abundance of all ſorts of Wild Fowl, Ducks, Teals, Wild-Geeſe, Pelicans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> reſort thither, as would bring much Profit in any Place, but <hi>Turky,</hi> were a Decoy made there. Here we lay all Night in our Boat. The next day we parted early; and keeping ſtill along the ſame Shore;<note place="margin">CONOPOLI.</note> we came to a Point about ſix Miles thence, called <hi>Conopoli.</hi> On the top of the Rock is a ruined Tower, with the Rubbiſh of a Town about it; but what it was formerly called, I know not. From the Foot of the Rock is a Spring of Hot, Salt, and <hi>Bituminous</hi> Water, which runneth down into the Sea, within a yard or two of its Source. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it I obſerved plenty of <hi>Common Alexanders, Cyclamen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">PLANTS.</note> or <hi>Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread; Anagyris foetida,</hi> then in flower, which grows to a good big Shrub, of a yard and half high; whoſe Twigs are ſet with a large three-fold Leaf, each of which are long, and ſomewhat narrow, of a deep green colour, and of a ſtrong ſtinking ſmell. The Flowers alſo grow out in little bunches, like the other <hi>Laburnum,</hi> but larger, and of a deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er yellow colour, ſpotted alſo with black, or Hare-colour'd Spots. The outward Leaf is the ſhorteſt; the next pair longer, and the inmoſt longeſt, all divided at the ends. The Flower is ſucceeded by a long Cod, like a <hi>French</hi> Bean; filled at like diſtances with a Seed as big, of a blue or purple colour, and exceeding hard. <hi>Staphys agria,</hi> or <hi>Staves-acre;</hi> not long come up from the Seeds. A kind of <hi>Bryony;</hi> not differing from the white above ground, only the Leaves were ſpotted with white Spots. Hence we had the Proſpect of a large Plain along the Shore beyond us, and behind us; but a good way within the Land, moſt part of it is covered with Pine-Trees.</p>

            <p>Continuing yet ſix or ſeven Miles further along the ſame Coaſts, we came to another point, called <hi>Cape Calogrea;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cape</hi> CALO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GREA.</note> where we were ſhewed a Well, or Fountain, called <hi>Durach-bey,</hi> becauſe dug by a famous <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Pirate of that Name. By this are the Mouths of two Rivers near to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or the ſame River emptying it ſelf by two Mouths; for our Mariners aſſured us they were diſtinct. One of them, very probab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is the River <hi>Lariſſus</hi> of the Antients;<note place="margin">LARISSUS <hi>Fluv.</hi>
               </note> which diſtinguiſhed the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Eleum</hi> and <hi>Dimaeum.</hi> Near the Banks of this River I obſerved great abundance of <hi>Anemonies,</hi> of the diſſected-leaf-kind, of many co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, as blue, white, red, and purple. The Mountain, which make this Promontory, is called by the Greeks <hi>Maurovouni,</hi>

This Place hath the advantage of a fair Proſpect, looking full into the Gulph of <hi>Lepanto</hi> North-Eaſt, with the two Caſtles at its Mouth. <hi>Patras,</hi> almoſt at the bottom of the Bay, made by this, and the <hi>Morean Promontory</hi> of the Gulph of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> or <hi>Corinth; Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa-longia</hi> North, a Promontory of <hi>Epirus</hi> North-Weſt, with a little Iſland, called <hi>Courtzolari.

            <p>From hence we croſſed over to ſee M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Pendarves,</hi> then lading of Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans on an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship, called the <hi>Merchant Factor,</hi> riding near <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa-longia</hi> and <hi>Nathaligo.</hi> Theſe are two little Towns, built like <hi>Venice</hi> upon little Iſlands, in the Shallows of the Sea, near the Shore of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Aetolia.</hi> No Ship, or Bark, can come near them by four or five Miles; nor to them at all, unleſs they will fetch them, in their little flat-bottom'd Boats, made of one piece of Wood, they therefore call <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxylo,</hi> as afore-ſaid: In which alſo they bring their Currans aboard, coming to and fro in calm Weather, as thick as Bees to a Hive. Both theſe Towns conſiſt, for the greateſt part, of Chriſtians, free from the Irregular Inſults of the <hi>Turks:</hi> But have a <hi>Turkiſh Veivode</hi> over them.</p>
            <p>Thence, after we had the ſatisfaction of ſeeing our good Friend, and of recruiting our Purſes, the thirtieth of <hi>December</hi> we proceeded more chearfully on our Voyage. Keeping along the Shore of <hi>Aetolia,</hi> we obſerved extraordinary great Flights of <hi>Pelicans,</hi> and other Fowls; and not far thence met with a Boat, that was a fiſhing; of whom, beſides a good diſh of Fiſh we bought, we obſerved, among the reſt, a kind of Fiſh the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Fulpo,</hi> and the <hi>Greeks Octopodia;</hi> becauſe at one end, ſpreading themſelves abroad, it is divided into eight long Points; each of which points are full of Knobs, like Warts, whereby it ſticketh faſt to any thing it toucheth. In the Center of theſe Feet is its place for the Evacuation of its Excrements; ſmelling as ſweet as Musk. The other end is a round, lumpy Subſtance, filled with its Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badge: whence the <hi>Italian</hi> Name ſeemeth to be taken. Here we ſaw alſo another ſort of Fiſh, of near a foot long, with a very ſharp Beak, and ſlender: They call it a <hi>Needle Fiſh.</hi> Another we ſaw, ſomething

            <p>From this Point we croſſed over to <hi>Patras,</hi> leaving on our right hand the Promontory <hi>Mauromidie,</hi> and about a dozen Miles from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tras,</hi> a Town in ſight of it, called <hi>Mamminizza,</hi> ſituated upon both ſides of a River, two or three Miles from the Sea. This Village was, in all likelihood, the antient City <hi>Olenus,</hi> and the River the antient <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus;</hi> which <hi>Pauſanias</hi> puts about ten Miles from <hi>Patras.</hi> Nearer to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tras</hi> one leaves the old Fortreſs of <hi>Achaia</hi> now ſlighted; and, as my Companion obſerves, a Torrent, whoſe Channel was then dry, called now by the <hi>Greeks Leucas,</hi> and by <hi>Pauſanias Glaucos;</hi> all which Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are in the <hi>Achaia</hi> of <hi>Peloponneſus.</hi> To the other hand, on the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manian</hi> Shore, are two very high-piked Mountains; the firſt of which is called <hi>Gallata,</hi> from a Town behind it, bearing that Name: which Monſieur <hi>Spon</hi> thinketh to be the antient <hi>Calydon.</hi> Beyond the other Mountain we had the two Caſtles at the Mouth of the Gulph in ſight. Of <hi>Calydon Pauſanias</hi> telleth this ſad Love ſtory: <q>
                  <hi>Coreſus,</hi> the Prieſt of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> fell in love with a fair Virgin of the Town, called <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirhoe;</hi> who the more ſhe was courted, the more ſhe deſpiſed the Prieſt; ſo that neither his rich Preſents, Vows, nor Tears could move her to the leaſt Compaſſion. This, at laſt, made the Prieſt run in deſpair to the Image of <hi>Bacchus</hi> for ſuccour, imploring Vengeance from him. <hi>Bacchus</hi> made it appear that he heard his Prayers, by a Diſeaſe he ſent on the Town; which ſeemed a kind of <hi>Drunken Madneſs,</hi> of which mad Fit the People died in abundance. Whereupon they ſent Deputies from <hi>Calydon,</hi> to the Oracle of <hi>Jupiter</hi> of <hi>Dodona;</hi> which was in reputation, in thoſe days, amongſt the <hi>Etolians, Acarnanians,</hi> and all the Country of <hi>Epirus,</hi> to know what they ſhould do to be freed from that woeful Malady. Anſwer was given, That <hi>Coreſus</hi> muſt ſacrifice <hi>Callirhoe,</hi> or ſome other Perſon, that would dedicate himſelf in her ſtead, to appeaſe the Anger of <hi>Bacchus.</hi> The Virgin, when ſhe could no way obtain her Life of her Relations, was brought to the Altar, adorn'd as Victims uſed to be, to be ſacrificed by her Lover <hi>Coreſus:</hi> Whoſe wonderful Love, even at that preſent, ſo conquered all paſt thoughts of Revenge, that inſtead of her he ſlew himſelf; and became a Victim to generous Love, inſtead of being any longer the Prieſt of <hi>Bacchus.</hi> The Virgin alſo, relenting of her Cruelty to him, went and ſlew her ſelf at a Fountain without the Town, from thence called by her name, <hi>Callirhoe.</hi>
               </q> But whether <hi>Gallata,</hi> or the Ruins of another Town, not far from thence towards <hi>Meſſalongia,</hi> which S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Harby</hi> told me he ſaw there, be the antient <hi>Calydon,</hi> I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin, unleſs I had ſeen them both. We arrived at <hi>Patras</hi> that After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon early.</p>

               <hi>Patras</hi> is ſituated upon an Hill,<note place="margin">PATRAS.

It hath a Caſtle on the higheſt Point of the Hill, and a Deſcent every way into a fruitful Valley, well planted with Orange,

               <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tras</hi> was the antient, as well as the modern Name of the Place; and is undoubtedly the ſame with that of the <hi>Romans,</hi> being made a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Colony by <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> after it had been, for ſome time, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by more antient Fates. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> telleth, That it was firſt built by one <hi>Eumelus,</hi> Native of the Country; who having received the manner how to build from <hi>Triptolemus,</hi> as likewiſe Corn, and how to ſow it, named the Place he built, from his tilling the Ground, <hi>Aroa.</hi> Afterwards, when the <hi>Ionians</hi> were driven out of the <hi>Peloponneſian A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaia,</hi> one called <hi>Patreus</hi> enlarged it; ſo that <hi>Aroa,</hi> and its Walls, were contained within the new Walls he made about it, and the City called by his own Name, <hi>Patras.</hi> After this it came again to be depopula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by occaſion of their ſending Succour to the <hi>Etolians</hi> againſt the <hi>French;</hi> by whom the <hi>Etolians</hi> being in many Combats defeated, the reſt that eſcaped, diſperſed themſelves into ſeveral Cities thereabout, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the time of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar;</hi> who being moved either with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of the Haven, or ſome other private Reaſon, commanded the People of ſundry Towns round about <hi>Patras,</hi> to come and abide there: Which that they might more willingly do, he adorned the Place with all the Priviledges of a <hi>Roman</hi> Colony; calling it <hi>Colonia Auguſti, Aroa Patrenſis,</hi> as may be confirmed by divers Medals. In my ſmall Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I have two. The firſt is of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> with this Reverſe: A Figure ſtanding in a <hi>Roman</hi> Habit, with a pair of Oxen before him; and theſe Letters above, <hi>Col. A. A.</hi> and under, <hi>Patrenſ.</hi> which are the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviation of <hi>Colonia Auguſti, Aroa Patrenſis,</hi> or <hi>Patrenſium;</hi> that is, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roa of the Patraſſians, the Colony or Plantation of</hi> Auguſtus. Another I have of the Emperour <hi>Domitian;</hi> which is the only one I have ſeen of that Reverſe, and never yet engraven. It hath for Reverſe a Pillar upon a large <hi>Baſis,</hi> which ſeemeth to me to be of the <hi>Ionick</hi> Order, with a Statue upon it, and round about theſe Letters, <hi>Col. A. A. Patrenſ.</hi> which are to be interpreted as the former. And by it may be learned, That <hi>Domitian</hi> adorned the Town with ſome Magnificent Pillar, on the top of which he placed his own Statue. And not long ſince, the <hi>French Vice-Conſul</hi> there found one in his Garden of the Emperour <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius;</hi> which had for Reverſe the Military Enſigns of the <hi>Romans,</hi> with the ſame Letters as before, only XXII added; which ſignifieth no more, than that the <hi>Twenty ſecond</hi> Legion was at that time there. As to the State of this Town in the <hi>Roman</hi> times, <hi>Pauſanias</hi> hath given an ample Account; what now remaineth of it, is but little in proportion: Although for that the deſtroying <hi>Turks,</hi> undoubtedly, ought to bear the blame, and not the Chriſtians; as may appear from the many ruined Churches, in all its antient bounds: which reached as far as the Sea Weſtwards; but not ſo far Eaſt: And having ſtill enjoyed the Honour of an Arch-Biſhoprick; whoſe Paſtor uſed, in antient times, to have the Thirty-ſecond Place in the Councils, or general Aſſemblies of the Church. The preſent Arch-Biſhop is called <hi>Daniel;</hi> whom we went to pay our Reſpects to. He told us, That he had a thouſand Churches in his Province; which extends it ſelf over all the Weſtern Parts of <hi>Morea,</hi> as far as <hi>Corone.</hi> There was another Metropolitan then with him, to wit, the Metropolitan of <hi>Napoli</hi> of <hi>Romagnia,</hi> called by
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:95495:115"/>the Greeks <hi>Anaplia.</hi> The two other Arch-Biſhopricks are <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Miſitra;</hi> ſituate not above four Miles from the antient Ruins of <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemon,</hi> as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Vernon</hi> affirmeth. The higheſt Point of the Hill, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the City ſtandeth, hath a Caſtle kept by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and commanded then by one <hi>Hebby-Bey.</hi> Within it formerly were the Temples of <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Li-pathria,</hi> and of <hi>Minerva Panachaida,</hi> or the <hi>Protectreſs</hi> of all <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaia.</hi> The Monument alſo of <hi>Euripilus,</hi> Son of <hi>Euaemon,</hi> who was at the ſacking of <hi>Troy:</hi> of which ſee <hi>Pauſanias.</hi> What now remains of them in the Caſtle, I can give no Account; becauſe we were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to enter into it. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſpeaketh of many more, in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place: But now there is only the <hi>Cathedral</hi> Church to be ſeen, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a <hi>Moſque.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We lodged at S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Clement Harby</hi>'s Houſe, Conſul of the <hi>Morea</hi> and <hi>Zant.</hi> He was not there at this time; but as we returned, he was, and ſhewed us many things we had not before ſeen. The firſt Evening we arrived there, we went to ſee the Church dedicated to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>John,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>George,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Nicholas,</hi> a little deſcending the Hill Weſtwards, where we heard the <hi>Greek</hi> Veſpers, worſe ſung than <hi>Hopkin</hi>'s Pſalms uſed to be in ſome of our Country Churches. It is a very antient Church; but hath ill-favour'd Arches within, though ſuſtained by beautiful Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the <hi>Ionique</hi> Order. On the out-ſide, among many ſcraps of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is the <hi>Baſſo relievo</hi> of a Peacock, ſitting upon a three-leav'd Tree, I gueſs to be <hi>Anagyris,</hi> which is not wanting in thoſe Parts: Whence we judged alſo, That the Church was built out of the Ruins of ſome Temple of <hi>Juno,</hi> which might have been thereabouts. At the Door of this Church is a Stone, which being ſtruck by another Stone, ſendeth out a ſtinking Bituminous Savour: This the <hi>Greeks</hi> make a Miracle, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, That the Judge, when he condemn'd S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Andrew,</hi> ſate upon that Stone; which hath ever ſince had that ill Scent. But I have ſmelt the like ſmell in other Stones, when broken; eſpecially a little long Stone found about <hi>Oxford,</hi> amongſt the Gravel. The report of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Andrew,</hi> That he ſtaid a great while at <hi>Patras;</hi> and that before he ſuffered Martyrdom there, he converted a King of the <hi>Morea;</hi> meaning, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, no more than ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Governour of that Province. They had antiently ſeveral Churches here dedicated to him; one of which we went next day to ſee, ſituated near the Sea-ſide; which is indeed a very old, ruinous Building. There are two great vaulted Rooms, ſtanding parallel to each other, in it; and the Foundations of two more appear on each ſide: which together are Forty ſix paces, and two feet wide. One of them, which I gueſs, was properly made uſe of for a Church, hath part of a <hi>Cuppalo</hi> yet ſtanding on the Eaſt end; with great Niches in it for Statues, and many leſſer in other Parts: Which made me then believe, that it had been more antiently either a <hi>Roman Temple</hi> or <hi>Bath;</hi> for by it I obſerved a Fountain of freſh Water, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is but a ſtone's-caſt from the Sea. And <hi>Pauſanias</hi> confirms me in the ſame; ſaying, That the Temple of <hi>Neptune</hi> and <hi>Ceres</hi> were ſituate in the lower Parts of the Town; and that this laſt had a Fountain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Wall, by which the Events of ſick Perſons were known, by hanging up a Looking-glaſs in ſuch ſort by a Thred, that it touched the Water only on the Back-ſide; in which Glaſs, the ſick Perſons looking,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:95495:115"/>ſaw Figures, which ſhewed what they muſt truſt to.</p>
            <p>Returning thence South-Eaſtwards, towards the Town, we paſt by the Ruins of a round Temple of Brick, maſoned together with a very hard Cement, and the Building very maſſive: over againſt which, North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, is a demoliſhed <hi>Greek</hi> Church, dedicated to the Holy Apoſtles; which hath been ſuſtained by Marble Pillars of the <hi>Ionique</hi> Order. Not far from hence appear ſome Parts of the antient Walls of the Town: One of thoſe Heaps of Ruins may have been the Temple of <hi>Cybele,</hi> the Mother of the Gods; wherein <hi>Attes</hi> alſo was honoured. But we could not find the <hi>Theater,</hi> nor the <hi>Odeum,</hi> nor many other Temples, which <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſpeaks of. Under the Wall of the Town is a Place, that ſeemeth to have been a <hi>Circus,</hi> or <hi>Stadium,</hi> or perhaps a <hi>Naumachia</hi> for Water Combats. For the <hi>Conſul</hi> told me, That many in the Town can yet remember, that there was an Iron Ring faſtened to the Wall; which they ſuppoſe, was to tie Veſſels to; ſuppoſing, that the Sea came up thither, in former days: but the other Buildings, nearer the Sea-ſide, evince that Errour. Perhaps, Water might be brought thither by a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, or Aqueduct: But the Sea is near a quarter of a Mile from thence, and lies much lower. The ſides conſiſted of Ranges of Arches; which Monſieur <hi>Spon</hi> remembers he hath ſeen repreſented on Medals of <hi>Patras.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Med. <hi>110.</hi>
               </note> Not far thence is the Foundation of a Church, dedicated to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Andrew;</hi> where they believe, that Apoſtle baptized the King he had converted to the Faith. The Building ſeemeth to have been formerly a <hi>Roman</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher. That which induceth me to think ſo, is a Vault underneath it; round which are Niches; in every one of which are two holes at the bottom, made with Earthen Pots; which are plaiſtered up, round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, to the top: juſt ſuch as I ſaw ſeveral at <hi>Baia,</hi> by <hi>Puzzuolo</hi> in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> That they are in Niches ſo by pairs, argueth, that it was done with deſign to put the Aſhes of the Husbands and Wives of the Family, near each other. But the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſay, The Pots were made to put Holy Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in; which they preſerve in Pots, making it but once a Year. How true this is, I know not: but it is certain, this Place hath ſince been made uſe of for a Church; and, perhaps, thoſe <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rns,</hi> or <hi>Ollae,</hi> made uſe of to hold Holy Water, in later times.</p>
            <p>Hence we went by the Town; and near two Miles beyond it South-Weſtwards, we came to the Gardens, called <hi>Glycada,</hi>
               <note place="margin">GLYCADA</note> where thoſe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Citrons grow, I told you of: Some of which we taſted very good; but the beſt were already deſtroyed by the <hi>French,</hi> who had been there to lade Proviſions for <hi>Meſſina.</hi> The biggeſt are as large as two, or three fair Limons; and the white within the Rind, is very well ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted; but the little Juyce it hath in the middle, is ſowr. Neither here, nor any where elſe in <hi>Turky</hi> do they obſerve any great Order in laying out, and making their Gardens. They ſet their Trees not ſo much as in rowes, nor take ſo much care of them, as we do of Apples and Pears. In the chiefeſt of theſe Gardens we ſaw a wonderful great Cypreſs-tree; whoſe Dimenſions I took, and are theſe: The Body, a foot from the Ground, is Twenty one foot about. Four foot from the ground, ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen foot and eleven inches about. The Boughs ſpread out from the Body, Twenty eight feet and a half, rather more than leſs. It makes a large, and moſt delightful Shade, ſcarce penetrable by the Sun. The
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:95495:116"/>Ground under it is laid in a Square, with Chanels for Water to run about it; which they have in plenty, and lead about as they pleaſe, to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Trees and Herbs. The good Man that kept the Garden, made us a Preſent of Oranges, Limons, Citrons, Pomegrantes, and Walnuts, in a handſom Basket, covered with Noſegays of Violets. Whereupon, ſending for Bread and Pitch-Wine, for which <hi>Patras</hi> is celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, we drank our Mornings Draught, and our Friends good Healths; wiſhing them as good Wine and Cheer, but not ſo far from their Homes to drink it. The Oranges here are much the ſame with <hi>Sevil Oranges,</hi> for taſte and ſhape.</p>
            <p>Hence we returned Northwards,<note place="margin">HIEROCO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIUM.</note> to the Covent <hi>Hierocomium,</hi> on the top of a Hill, which hath about a dozen <hi>Caloyers,</hi> and a Church dedicated to the Holy Virgin; which is built with no great Art, but well adorned according to their Mode, with Pictures and Silver Lamps before them. Here is a Latine Inſcription in this Church; but ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, that not much can be learned from it. My Comerade ſpeaks of another we ſaw; which ſhewed, That the Covent was built out of the Ruins of the Fortreſs of <hi>Achaia,</hi> which is about ten Miles from <hi>Patras.</hi> It is writ in Modern <hi>Greek,</hi> very difficult to be copied or read.</p>

            <p>From this Monaſtery is a good Proſpect over the Plain, Southward, well planted with Olive-yards, Vine-yards, and Corn. There is ſuch another Northwards of the City; but not ſeen from thence.</p>
            <p>Thence returning to the Town, over the Hills, Weſtwards, we paſſed by an antient <hi>Aqueduct,</hi> whoſe Ruins are very high and ſtately; but of Brick. It hath two Arches one above another; and the <hi>Pilaſter</hi> of each is propped on both ſides with Buttrices of the ſame. Higher up the Stream are two more, and better preſerved. All of them joyn two Hills together; between which runs a ſmall Stream; which was, perhaps, the <hi>Miliclus.</hi> For it is the neareſt to the Town on the Eaſt-ſide. If ſo, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its Banks was ſituate the Temple of <hi>Diana Triclaria:</hi> on its Banks was alſo an Altar, whereupon Human Sacrifices were offered to <hi>Diana Lapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thria;</hi> whoſe Temple was in the Caſtle. The reaſon of which <hi>Pauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> relateth to this effect: <q>Her Rites being celebrated by Virgins, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they were married; It happened, that a young and beautiful Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, called <hi>Comaethlia,</hi> had that Office; with whom a Youth of the Town, of no leſs Comlineſs, and excellent Proportion, fell deeply in love; and without difficulty, gain'd the Virgin's Heart: But when he asked his froward Father's conſent, he denied him, and would by
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:95495:116"/>no means conſent to it. The Lovers being impatient of ſo unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral a Reſtraint, continu'd their Amours, and fulfilled their Deſires ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly in the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> as if they had been married. But ſoon after both died, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> and paid for their Impiety to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs: for after a little while the Ground was ſtruck with a great Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs, and the City with a dreadful Peſtilence: Upon which the Oracle of <hi>Delphos</hi> being conſulted, Anſwer was made, That the luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Actions of <hi>Menalippus</hi> and <hi>Comaethlia</hi> was the reaſon; and that to appeaſe <hi>Diana,</hi> they muſt yearly ſacrifice to her the moſt beautiful Youth, and Virgin of the whole Town: Which Cuſtom was to laſt, till an unknown King ſhould come, and bring a ſtrange Deity with him. In Proceſs of time, when <hi>Troy</hi> was taken, and overthrown by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> in the diviſion of the Spoil, and ſacking of the Town, <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rypylus,</hi> King of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> lighted upon a Coffer, which contain'd an Image of <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> or <hi>Bacchus,</hi> made by <hi>Vulcan,</hi> for an Offering to <hi>Jupiter Dardanius.</hi> This Coffer <hi>Eurypylus</hi> no ſooner look'd into, but he became Lunatick, with very little or no intermiſſion. Wherefore he return'd not directly home to <hi>Theſſaly;</hi> but ſailed firſt to <hi>Cyrrha,</hi> and came thence to <hi>Delphos,</hi> to conſult the Oracle there: Whoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was, That when he came to a Place, where he found the People offering a ſtrange Sacrifice, he ſhould there dedicate his Image, and there abide. Thence returning, the Winds brought him to <hi>Patras;</hi> where he went aſhore, and by chance found the People about to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice a Youth, and a Virgin, who were then ſtanding at the Altar of <hi>Diana Triclaria,</hi> ready to be ſlain: which made him quickly call to mind the words of the Oracle, that agreed ſo well to what he ſaw here. The People alſo, ſeeing a ſtrange King, whom they had neither ſeen, nor heard of before, were no leſs moved at his Preſence, and at the Coffer which he brought; not doubting, but that it contain'd ſome ſacred thing, as it did. So that remembring the Anſwers <hi>Apollo</hi> had ſeverally given them, there was great Joy on both ſides; the King, that he found himſelf by this means reſtored to his right Mind; and the City, that they were delivered and ſet free from ſuch a barbarous Cuſtom. From this cruel Sacrifice, the River, at which it was, uſually done, had got the Name of <hi>Amilichus,</hi> which is as much as to ſay <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmerciful.</hi> But when the wicked Rite and Cuſtom thus expired, it came to be called <hi>Milichus,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>Compaſſionate,</hi> or <hi>Tender-hearted;</hi> whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was not known to have any Name at all.</q> The Stream runs thence South-Weſtwards, and ſo winds about the Town to the Sea.</p>
            <p>Thence paſſing over the River, and up the Hill near the Town, we came to the <hi>Jews</hi> Burying-place; where I obſerved their Sepulchers to be made in the faſhion of little Houſes of Stone-building; having at each end a Marble-Stone, whereon is engraven an Inſcription of their Name and Family: which looking like the Doors of the little Houſes of Death, make the Burying-place ſeem a great Town, when it is viewed at a diſtance from the wrong end of a Microſcope.</p>
            <p>From hence leaving the Town on the left hand, we paſſed by the Caſtle on our right; which is not much conſiderable, either for Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Strength; having only one round Tower toward the Sea, a broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide towards the Town, and ditch'd round about; being then comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:95495:117"/>by a <hi>Turk,</hi> called <hi>Hebbey-Bey,</hi> as is above-mentioned. Here is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a <hi>Caddy,</hi> or Judge, to determine Civil Controverſies, and a <hi>Veivode,</hi> whoſe Office it is to execute the Determinations of the <hi>Caddy,</hi> and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Rights and Duties upon Merchandizes and Proviſions. He that was then <hi>Veivode,</hi> was called <hi>Abdi-Aga;</hi> who from his <hi>Sopha</hi> ſpied my Comrade walking by before his Window; and perceiving him to be a Stranger, ſent a <hi>Janizary</hi> to him, to bring him before him; where, by a <hi>Jew,</hi> that was his Interpreter, he examin'd him <hi>what he was,</hi> and <hi>what he did in that Country?</hi> My Companion anſwered, That he was a Phyſician; and that his paſſing near thoſe parts was, that he went to ſee a Friend of his, that was Conſul at <hi>Athens.</hi> The Interpreter then made him underſtand, That he ought to have made the <hi>Veivode</hi> ſome Preſent, ſtaying in the Town. But to this he made him a Compliment, telling him, That he was no Merchant, that only bad Weather ſtaid him in Town, and that he had brought hardly enough to defray his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences; far from being able to make Preſents to a Perſon of his Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: and ſo he was diſmiſſed. His Brother alſo, <hi>Haly Baſha,</hi> who was Maſter of the Cuſtoms, hoped to have had ſomething of us in this kind; and for fear we ſhould part without paying his Dues, took the Rudder of our Barque, and locked it up in the Cuſtom-Houſe. The <hi>Turks</hi> are about a Third Part of the Town; with the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> the other Two Parts. They have ſix Moſques; one of which was formerly the Cathedral Church, and hath an Iron Chain gilded with Gold, hanging on the top of the <hi>Cuppalo:</hi> Which was the reaſon, that when it was taken from the <hi>Venetians,</hi> as they ſay, the Town was pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; the <hi>Turks</hi> believing it to be Maſſive Gold, and that they could not but have great Riches in the City. The <hi>Jews,</hi> who make the ſecond <hi>Third-part</hi> of the Town, have four Synagogues, with a kind of Polity among themſelves, and chuſing antient Men to decide their own Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. The whole number of <hi>Chriſtians, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> are reputed about four or five thouſand. Their Trade conſiſts in raw Silks, made in the <hi>Morea,</hi> in good quantity. Leather is alſo cheap; and ſo is Honey, Wax, Wool, and Cheeſe. The Currans of <hi>Patras</hi> are eſteemed the beſt in thoſe Parts; but they have no great quantity of them: <hi>Patras, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaligo,</hi> and <hi>Meſſa-longia,</hi> all three together, having enough to lade on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one good Ship every year. Here we went to viſit the Vice-Conſul of the <hi>French,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Vitelin;</hi> who ſhewed us a Marble Head of a Statue, found in digging his Garden; but ſo defaced, that it could not be known for whom it was made: As alſo a Gold-Ring, ſet with a Stone, having a Caſtle engraven on it, and certain Gothick Letters about it.</p>
            <p>We went alſo to viſit the <hi>Venetian</hi> Conſul, to have a Paſs-port of him, becauſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſul was not then there; and alſo becauſe our Boat-men were of <hi>Zant,</hi> under the <hi>Venetians.</hi> For none can paſs in and out again the Gulph of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> without leave of one of the Caſtles at the Mouth; which Caſtles are ſo near to each other, that it is impoſſible to paſs out of Gun-ſhot of one, or other, or both of them. Beſides, if they let you paſs into it, at <hi>Lepanto</hi> one runs the riſque of having the Barque burned; and an <hi>Aveny</hi> ſet upon you beſides. To enter the Gulph, leave muſt be had of the Caſtle of <hi>Morea;</hi> and to come out, of
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:95495:117"/>that of <hi>Romelia:</hi> for ſo only they diſtinguiſh them. But when we had gotten this Inſtrument, we wanted another, to wit, the Rudder of our Bark; which, as I ſaid, the <hi>Emir,</hi> or Receiver of Cuſtoms, had taken away, that we might not part without his Knowledge. We could not for ſometime find him; and when we did, we were forced to buy it of him at the price of half a Crown.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>January</hi> the firſt,<note place="margin">LEPANTO.</note> we parted from <hi>Patras,</hi> and came to <hi>Lepanto</hi> that Evening, though it was paſt Noon when we took Water. For we were preſently diſmiſs'd at the Caſtle; and it is not eſteem'd above a dozen Miles diſtance from <hi>Patras</hi> to <hi>Lepanto;</hi> being in ſight of each other. From one Caſtle to the other, is not above a Mile: But then the Gulph widens again on each ſide, unto <hi>Lepanto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lepanto</hi> is now the chief City of this Gulph, and of late hath given Name to it. It was called formerly <hi>Naupactus;</hi> and by the <hi>Greeks</hi> now, <hi>Epactos;</hi> only by the <hi>Franks, Lepanto. Ptolomy</hi> reckons it among thoſe of <hi>Locris Ozelorum.</hi> It is ſituate upon a very ſteep Hill, with a Deſcent every way from the top; but it is joyned to a Mountain behind it, by two other little Hills; which, ſince the Invention to a Mountain behind it, by two other little Hills; which, ſince the Invention of Gun-powder, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it: But it was ſo ſtrong in antient times, that it gave much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet to the <hi>Romans,</hi> being a Refuge for the Rebellious <hi>Etolians.</hi> It is built from the Sea-ſhore up to the higheſt Point of the Hill, which is crowned with a little Caſtle; to mount to which, one muſt paſs no leſs than four Ranges of Walls, one above another; which makes it, at a diſtance, ſomewhat reſemble the <hi>Papal Crown.</hi> Their little Oval Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is no ſmall Ornament to it, being placed in the middle of the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and having a little Tower at each ſide of the Entrance, with ſome
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:95495:118"/>ſmall Braſs Guns in them. But the Mouth is ſo narrow, that it may be ſecured by a Chain of fifty foot long; and is too ſhallow for any Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, beſides Barques, and ſmall Gallies; of which the laſt cannot come in, but in high Water. For there is a kind of Tide in this Gulph; in the Morning the Water comes in by the Caſtles, and in the Evening it goes out; as Monſieur <hi>Spon</hi> obſerved in his Return. This Harbour is well walled about within, and the Work looks antient.</p>
            <p>On each ſide of the City, under the Mountain, which I take to be the Mountain <hi>Corax,</hi> are fruitful Valleys to the Seaward: That Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is well planted with Olive-Trees, Vineyards, and Corn: That Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is no leſs well-ſet, and divided into Gardens of Oranges, Citrons, and Limons without Seeds; being alſo well water'd with many pretty Streams, that iſſue out of the Rocky Mountain above it; and in the Summer, 'tis ſhaded with abundance of large Plane-trees. There are not many Chriſtians here, the greateſt part being <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews;</hi> and hath been a very great Harbour for Pirats. This was the Reſidence of the famous Corſair, <hi>Durach-Bey;</hi> who made the Ships and Barques of the Chriſtians, in theſe Parts, tremble; and had the beſt Houſe in the Town; although bad is the beſt now. He was for his valour ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to be a <hi>Captain Baſha</hi> in the War of <hi>Candia:</hi> But he had not long enjoyed that Honour, before he was ſlain, and that in an Enterprize of his own undertaking; which was to ſurprize the <hi>Venetian Armada</hi> by night. But they having notice of the deſign, he was ſurpriz'd himſelf, and after a bloody Conflict, was defeated with his Squadron, and ſlain by a Cannon-Bullet.</p>
            <p>The Trade of this Place conſiſts in Leather, Oyl, Tabaco, Rice, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and Wheat. Furrs alſo are good cheap here; and therefore, by the Advice of our Hoſt, we lined our Veſts with good Fox-skins; which was but needful: For the Winter proved extream cold in thoſe Parts; and as we had from our Lodging the Proſpect of thoſe Mountains about the Gulph covered with Snow; ſo had we our ſhare of the cold Wind, that blew from them, by reaſon of the bad Lodging provided us by the <hi>Frank-Conſul,</hi> called <hi>Signior Samuel,</hi> on the Harbour. He informed us, That all who paſs out of the Gulph, pay three <hi>per Cent.</hi> Cuſtom to the <hi>Emir,</hi> who payeth Six thouſand Crowns a year Rent for his Office. No great Ships of the <hi>Franks</hi> are permitted to come within the Caſtles; but ſtay at <hi>Patras,</hi> and ſend in their Barques. Concerning which our Hoſt told us, That during the War at <hi>Meſſina,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Veſſel coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, although he ſtaid without the Caſtles with his Ship, and only with its Bark came thither, to treat with the <hi>Emir</hi> concerning the Cuſtom, and lodged with our Hoſt, the Vice-Conſul: Yet ſo ſoon as the <hi>Vei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vode</hi> heard of it, he ſent for him forthwith, and without any more ceremony had him baſtinadoed; telling him, He had brought hither <hi>Malteſi</hi> and <hi>Corſairs:</hi> while he in vain endeavoured to make his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and tell him, That the Ship came from <hi>Meſſina,</hi> and belonged to the King of <hi>France.</hi> For he ſtill confounded <hi>Malta</hi> with <hi>Meſſina,</hi> and would not underſtand any difference; until he had obliged the Captain of the Ship to pay him fifty Crowns, and given charge to get him gone with all ſpeed.</p>
            <pb n="301" facs="tcp:95495:118"/>
            <p>Another came ſome time after, and to compliment the <hi>Veivode,</hi> ſent him ſome Sweet-meats by the Vice-Conſul; which inſtead of being pleas'd with, the proud <hi>Turk</hi> ſent him back with this Anſwer: <hi>What! does your Merchant take me to be a Child, that he ſends me Sweet-meats; and not Coffee, or ſomething proper for Men?</hi> But I believe, Time, and ſome little prudent Behaviour towards them, would make them more tame; eſpecially when they ſhould begin to find the Profit, which Trading would bring them. For nothing ſo covetous, as a <hi>Turk:</hi> and indeed they have ſome reaſon to make the beſt of their Offices; for they pay commonly very dear for them.</p>
            <p>We came in a very ill time to ſee this Place: For the next day, ſo ſoon as it was light, all the Barques were ſeized upon, to bring over the <hi>Baſha</hi> of the <hi>Morea;</hi> who had received Orders to come hither, and to <hi>Saint Mauro,</hi> to burn all the Galliots, or ſmall Gallies of the Pirates he ſhould find there. But they ſtaid not to be ſo complemented by him. The whole Town was in a Conſternation at his coming; none ſtirred aborad, none opened their Shops or Doors. However we had the opportunity to ſee his Reception, without ſtirring out of our Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; it over-looking the Harbour. The whole of his Train was near Five hundred Perſons; of which fifty Sclavonians were his Guard. He croſſed over from <hi>Voſtitza,</hi> a Town of the <hi>Morea,</hi> oppoſite to <hi>Lepanto.</hi> Before him in a Boat came Kettle-Drums, others playing upon <hi>Haut-Boys;</hi> and another ſtringed Inſtrument, play'd on by a Moor: Between which we could conceive no manner of Harmony. Before him alſo was carried upon a pole, two Horſes Tails, the Marks of his Dignity. At his Arrival the Port ſaluted him with five Guns, and the <hi>Veivode, Caddi,</hi> and other chief Officers of the Town, came to the Gate at his Landing, to kiſs his Veſt, and receive him with all the Reſpect they were capable to give him. So ſoon as he was landed, he mounted on Horſe-back, and was conducted to the <hi>Veivode</hi>'s Houſe; the reſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying him on foot. The next day he clapped the <hi>Emir</hi> in Priſon, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of his Brother, who had murdered one of the Town a great while ago: But he came off again for a Sum of Money; which was all the <hi>Baſha</hi> deſir'd. The next day after he demanded fifty Horſes of the <hi>Turks,</hi> fifty of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and thirty of the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> theſe being the leaſt Part of the Town.</p>
            <p>The Wind being bad, we could not proceed by Sea; and our <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Hoſt ſo frighted us with the danger of Robbers by Land, that our <hi>Greek</hi> refuſed abſolutely to go farther with us, unleſs by Water. For he was a kind of Water-man, and was not of their Faith, that had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truſt God Almighty by Land, than by Sea. Yet he haſtened us to be gone, ſhewing us the Danger we were in, ſtaying there, and what Peril himſelf alſo ran for entertaining us. And to ſpeak the truth, we were no leſs willing to be gone, than he was to have us gone. For we found no great Encouragement, either in the Curioſities of the Place, or his Entertainment, to make us ſtay.</p>
            <p>So, <hi>January</hi> the fifth, we took a Boat, and paſſed over to the Caſtle of the <hi>Morea,</hi> to attend there better Weather; which we did, till we were weary with attending, it being ten or twelve days time: For we had not the Honour to be lodged in the Caſtle; no Chriſtians whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:95495:119"/>being permitted to enter into it. But we were forced to make a vertue of Neceſſity, and content our ſelves, to take up our habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a place not much bigger or better than a Tomb, like the Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mentioned in the Goſpel: Which was a Brick Building, arched over, of ſix foot broad, and fifteen foot long; and the Floor digg'd two foot deep below ground. It had two ſuch holes, one a top, and another below, as would neither let out the Smoak, nor let in the Light: But cold enough. This Room ſerved us for all the Offices of a ſpacious Houſe; the worſt was, when it came to its turn to be made a Kitchin: not but that we might well enough have endured the Fire, if our Eyes could have agreed as well with the Smoak. Our Patron of the Barque lent us his Sail to ſpread on the Floor; on which lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Quilts, we made but a bad ſhift, the Place being very damp. But the Wetneſs producing good ſtore of Ruſhes thereabouts, I taught them at laſt to be Matt-makers, by tying handfuls of long Ruſhes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with Pack-thred we had by us. Theſe we laid under our Quilts, and to ſtop out the Cold. The Fountain <hi>Argyra,</hi> of good freſh Water at our Door, was our beſt Accommodation. For as to our Wine, we ſent for it two or three Miles off; our Bread we had from <hi>Patras;</hi> and our Meat from the Mountains, at about a Mile or two's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>One day, to take the Air, I went to the Mountains, with our <hi>Greek,</hi> and a Guide, to get Proviſions; and having paſſed by ſome Flocks, not above two Miles from us; not finding the Shepherds with them, we began to aſcend the foot of the Mountain; and being gat up upon a Hill, at a good diſtance we ſaw thirty or forty, ſitting in a round heap toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This made me preſently to call to mind the pleaſant Stories I had heard of the <hi>Arcadian</hi> Shepherds, from whoſe Country we were now not far diſtant: I thought of nothing, but being diverted by ſome Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival, ſome Sport or other among them; or, at leaſt, that there had been the Nuptials of ſome fair Shepherdeſs, then celebrated: At which the Shepherds being weary of dancing, were now ſet down to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themſelves with the noble Wine of the Country, a fat Lamb of their Flocks, or with ſome Ruſtick Sonnets, and old Wives Tales. But ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching nearer, I was ſoon undeceiv'd; finding an old Grey-bearded <hi>Turk,</hi> ſitting in the middle of the Circle, like a Conjurer, with his Lap full of Pebles, Pen, Ink, and Paper by him, and giving each of them their Task; which was to turn five of thoſe Stones into ſo many Dollers, by the next day at that time, upon pain of being made Slaves, and ſent chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Gallies, if they failed. This was for their <hi>Caratch,</hi> or <hi>Poll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money.</hi> There were other Accounts alſo to be made up among them. For their Flocks are not their own, but the <hi>Grand Signiors;</hi> of which they have the tenth Part of the Profit, and Fruit for their Labour; paying the other Duties that are impoſed upon them. The number of Pebles that were then to be made Dollers, was Four hundred and thirteen; by a People, that I dare engage, knew nothing of the <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi>'s <hi>Stone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their manner of living there, is in little Hutts, made of long Sedge; which they joyn together with Sticks, and Withs, in ſuch ſort, that a Covering of theſe keeps off the Rain from the top; and as for the Wind,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:95495:119"/>as that changeth, ſo they turn their Doors to the Lee of it; making a Fire before it. Theſe are their Winter Houſes, when they are forced from the tops of the Mountains covered with Snow, into the Valleys. For in the Summer they have Villages they live in, upon the Mountains; and there with greater ſecurity feed their Sheep, and witner in theſe little Hutts; therein crowding themſelves, and Wives, and Children toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Their Habit is ordinarily made of White Cloth, of the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Wool of their Flocks; being a large Cloak, with a Hood of the ſame joyned to it, and hanging down behind, or to cover their Heads with, when they have occaſion: For ordinarily, on their Heads, they wear a kind of Hat, made of Wool, in which their Hoods enter not; but is flat, and ſits cloſe to their Heads, having a good big Knob on the top, and tied under their Chin with long ſtrings, like a Cardinal's Cap; by which, when they pleaſe, they can let it hang on their Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and put on their Hood. Their Under-garment is commonly a Fuſtian Shirt, made ſo wide, that they let it hang ſometimes quite on the outſide their Breeches.</p>
            <p>The Women have a very odd kind of dreſs for their Heads; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a half Circle, or <hi>Creſcent,</hi> of Tin or Braſs, ſet an end upon their Heads; with a Girdle about their Middle of the ſame Metal, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of many Scales of Braſs; which is girded about ſuch a Linnen Garment, as the Men wear; but longer, and embroidered with red Yarn about the Neck, Sleeves, and Bottom. Their Shooes are only dried Skins, laced together with Leather, or Strings, about their Feet. Having made our Market, we returned with more Melancholy, than Satisfaction, to ſee theſe poor Chriſtians in ſo miſerable a Condition; bringing with us a very good fat Sheep for five Timins; that is, about two Shillings: which was a Groat more, than is uſual to pay there for them.</p>

            <p>After a very ſtormy Night, twelfth day in the Morning, ſo ſoon as we opened the Door of our Houſe, we found one of theſe ſorts of Fowls,<note place="margin">PELICANS</note> we call <hi>Pelicans,</hi> the Modern <hi>Greeks, Toubana:</hi> Monſieur <hi>Spon</hi> thinks the ſame, that <hi>Pliny</hi> calls <hi>Onocrotalus.</hi> Whether benummed with cold, or that it had been ſhot, I know not; but we eaſily caught it with Stones. It hath a Body as big as a Swan; but the Neck not ſo long: the Feet webbed, and is of a grey colour, like a common Gooſe. We meaſured the Beak of this to be ſeventeen Inches long; broad in the largeſt part, an Inch and half; from the Beak to the Crown of the Head, five Inches. The end of the Beak turneth into a ſharp Hook, which, perhaps, helps it to catch Fiſh. The under part of the Beak is proportionable to the upper in length; and breadth alſo, when it is ſhut together: but when it openeth, it enlargeth it ſo, that it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, as I gueſs, half a foot wide; it being of a bending ſubſtance, much like a Whale's Bone; and the two Jaws of it joyned together at the end, as if it was but one piece bent together. To this, near to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Throat, is joyned a bag, of a skinny ſubſtance, like a Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before it is blown; which ſhrinketh it ſelf ſo much together, that it is not ſeen, when the Mouth is ſhut, or the Bag empty: but when filled, it will ſtretch to an incredible bigneſs. When it was dead, we tied a ſtring about the Throat, that no Water could paſs down the Belly, and tried how much Water this Bag would hold. We had a wooden Kan there, whoſe Dimenſions were theſe:

                  <item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Five of theſe <hi>Kans</hi> of Water we put into the Bag; uſing no other Art
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:95495:120"/>to make it ſtretch, than meerly the weight of the Water, as we filled it: which I verily judge to have been in the whole, no leſs than ten or a dozen Quarts. After this we opened it, and found the Throat down to the Breaſt, large enough to ſwallow a Carp of a foot long; thence to the Gizzard, but ſmall. The Gizzard is not of a round fleſhy ſubſtance, as other Fowls; but near half a Foot long, and an Inch and Quarter <hi>Diameter;</hi> of a thicker ſubſtance, than the reſt of the Guts, before or after. The Lungs of a skinny Subſtance, ſticking faſt on each ſide to the Ribs; but a little red. In its Gizzard were many live, ſmall Worms; which I know not, whether it were his Meat, or his Diſeaſe. The Blood and Fleſh were very black; and therefore, I ſuppoſe, very bad Meat. They are in vaſt numbers all about theſe Seas, as well as at <hi>Smyrna.</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> ſay, With theſe Bags they carry Fiſh, and Water to their Young Ones in the Mountains, where they breed.</p>
            <p>Another day, walking abroad, I found one of thoſe <hi>Tree-Froggs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">TREE-FROGGS.</note> which I met with, and only mentioned, at <hi>Epheſus.</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> call it <hi>Spordaca.</hi> Both of thoſe, which I ſaw, were ſmall in ſhape, like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but of a deep green colour, like a green Wallnut; and when it lies cloſe to the Ground, reſembles the better half of a Wall-nut ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flat. For then it doubleth its Feet ſo cloſe under it, that it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth one entire piece. The Nature of this <hi>Frogg</hi> is much different from that of others: For thoſe delight to be ſtill on the Ground among Graſs, or in the Water; whereas this kind delights to climb Trees, Buſhes, and Shrubs, and to ſit chirping upon them. For which purpoſe alſo Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath made Proviſion; its Toes ending in a little round Knob, like a Pins-head; out of which iſſueth ſuch a clammy Subſtance, that leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Bough to Bough, like a Squirrel, whereſoever it toucheth with any of its Feet, it hangeth, and gets up its whole Body, as I often tried. I did not perceive, that it held by graſping with its Feet, as Birds and Squirrels do; but only ſticking, by that clammy Subſtance, to the ſmootheſt Leaves. I kept one ſeveral days with us, upon a Bough of <hi>Lentiſcus,</hi> ſticking the Bough into the Wall. I put it into the Water, and found it would ſwim like other Frogs; but made all the haſte ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, to be out of that colder Element, and never offered to dive under Water at all. To ſee how it will recover it ſelf by one Foot, touching a Bough or Leaf, is very wonderful, and almoſt paſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
            <p>From the Mountains here run down many Streams, and paſs into the Sea, within the Gulph. And between <hi>Patras,</hi> and the Promontory <hi>Dre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panum,</hi> which is within the Gulph of <hi>Lepanto, Pauſanias</hi> mentions four Rivers, and a Fountain; but ſomewhat confuſedly for want of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing which are without, and which are within the Promontory <hi>Rhion.</hi> The firſt is the River <hi>Milichus,</hi> which I ſpake of already at <hi>Patras,</hi> which riſeth among the Hills behind the Town, and falleth into the Sea South-Weſtwards of it. The next is the River <hi>Charadrus,</hi> which I place within the Promontory <hi>Rhion,</hi> becauſe I obſerved no Stream between <hi>Patras,</hi> and the Caſtles, and the Fountain <hi>Argyra,</hi> which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Caſtles next following it. To this River <hi>Charadrus,</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try round about uſed to bring their Cattle in the Spring to drink, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:95495:121"/>that their Young Ones would be much the larger for it. The Fountain <hi>Argyra,</hi> I ſuppoſe, is that which I mentioned within the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory <hi>Rhion,</hi> or the Caſtles, about a Mile, near the little Hut, I ſaid, we ſtaid at ſo long, expecting a Wind. And the River <hi>Selemnus,</hi> one of thoſe Streams next to it, which <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſaith, The <hi>Patraſſians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, would cure thoſe in Love, that waſhed themſelves therein: Which was the Gift of <hi>Venus</hi> to it, pitying the Shepherd <hi>Selemnus,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken by the inconſtant Nymph <hi>Argyra,</hi> when his Blooming Youth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to decay. Next to this, he mentions the River <hi>Bolinaeus;</hi> the chaſte Nymph that gave Name to which, being purſued by <hi>Apollo,</hi> wilfully threw her ſelf into the Sea head-long, to avoid his foul Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces.</p>
            <p>I obſerved, that <hi>Terebinthus</hi> grows not large here, but bears Cods of <hi>Opobalſamum.</hi>
               <note place="margin">CHARA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DRUM.</note> There grows abundance of Myrtle here alſo, and a ſort of <hi>Iris,</hi> with Leaves like Graſs, and a curious Azure-coloured Flower. The Wind continuing yet contrary, after eleven days ſtay in this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Hole, we began to be ſo weary, that we did not know how to diſpoſe of our ſelves: and conſidering what was to be done to deliver us from theſe tedious Paſſages by Sea, in which we found we had no good Fortune, we concluded to go back to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Pendarves</hi> at the Ship, and furniſh our ſelves with ſo much Money, as would carry us quite through <hi>Greece</hi> to <hi>Vienna;</hi> where I ordered Letters of Credit to meet us. Therefore we made a Bargain with our Patron, <hi>Derviſh Haly,</hi> to carry us thither. So we hoiſed Sail, and came that Evening under the Mountain <hi>Galata,</hi> I before mentioned. Here we found another Barque, that had ſtaid eight days for the ſame Wind that we wanted, in a little Bay that ſtands in the Lee under this Mountain: from which iſſueth a Spring of very good freſh Water. The <hi>Greeks</hi> call it <hi>Crio Nero,</hi> or the <hi>Cold Water:</hi> for they ſay, It is very cold in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Perhaps this was, in former Times, the <hi>Callirrhoe</hi> of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients.</p>

            <p>Though it began to be dark, I made ſhift to clamber up the ſide to the Rock, and gathered a bundle of Herbs; among which, when I came into the Barque, I found a kind of Spurge I had not before ſeen. It is a Shrub, that groweth in a ſmall round Buſh of a Foot high, ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infinitely into Branches, until it bends every way down to the Ground, and is every way guarded with Bunches of Thorns at the top: among which ſpring up young tender Branches, full of ſmall Leaves, ſhaped like <hi>Hypericon,</hi> full of Milk; and on the top, Knots of Flowers, like the other <hi>Tithymaus;</hi> the Stems of which I judge to grow hard, and turn into Thorns. This I ſaw afterwards in many Parts of <hi>Greece,</hi> in the Plains of <hi>Athens,</hi> and on the <hi>Iſthmus.</hi> There groweth <hi>Fuſt</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, or <hi>Yellow-wood,</hi> uſed to dye with; called by the <hi>Greeks, Chryſoxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> or <hi>Golden-wood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Morning early, we came to the Ship to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Pendarves;</hi> where having diſpatched our buſineſs, we refreſhed our ſelves, and the next day, the Wind favouring of us, we croſſed over to <hi>Patras.</hi> This time we found S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Clement Harby,</hi> the Conſul of the <hi>Morea</hi> there; who entertained us very civilly at his Houſe, and ſhewed us many things we had not ſeen at our firſt being there, as I ſaid before. Of him we had a new Paſs-port; and ſtaying ſeveral days in his Houſe, we had almoſt concluded with him, to have firſt made the Tour of <hi>Morea.</hi> But the Wind at laſt changing South-Weſt, which was for our turn to paſs into the Gulph of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> taking Horſes, we haſted to the Caſtles, and made a Bargain with the ſame Maſter of the Barque, for eight Dollers, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry us to <hi>Salona.</hi> From <hi>Patras</hi> to the Caſtles, we paſſed through a Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley well planted with Olive-trees, and a pretty Village about midway,<note place="margin">SIKIDA. SCIESSA.</note> called <hi>Sikida;</hi> perhaps it is where <hi>Solinus</hi> mentions <hi>Scieſſa,</hi> remarkable
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:95495:122"/>only for ſuch ſhady Hills, as the Sun could hardly paſs through. But we found nothing of the Temple of <hi>Neptune,</hi> which <hi>Ptolomy</hi> puts in the mid-way, nor any other Antiquity. From <hi>Patras</hi> to the Caſtles, they account it nine Miles; but it cannot be above ſix or ſeven of our Miles: which alſo agreeth with <hi>Pauſanias</hi> his fifty <hi>Stadia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday</hi> the nineteenth of <hi>January</hi> 1675/6, in the Evening we parted from the Caſtles, and left about three Miles thence at our right hand, a ruined Village, called <hi>Drepano,</hi> near to a Cape, called antiently <hi>Dre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panum</hi> by <hi>Pauſanias</hi> and <hi>Strabo:</hi> But <hi>Ptolomy</hi> ſeemeth to confound it with <hi>Rhium,</hi> and calleth it <hi>Trepanum,</hi> which without doubt, is that by the Caſtle, making the narroweſt <hi>Streight</hi> between it ſelf, and <hi>Antirrhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> the oppoſite Promontory in the Confines of <hi>Aetolia,</hi> and <hi>Locris;</hi> which are counted by <hi>Strabo,</hi> not above five <hi>Stadia</hi> diſtant from each other. This Promontory was called <hi>Drepanum,</hi> becauſe the Sea maketh a Bay betweeen <hi>Rhium</hi> and it, faſhioned like a reaping Hook or Sickle; which ſignifies ſo much in <hi>Greek.</hi> And moreover they fanſied. that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> of old time did caſt his Sickle there, to make it. From <hi>Drepanum,</hi> further in the Continent, is a Town called <hi>Aderna;</hi> and further, near the Sea, another called <hi>Voſtitza.</hi> The Wind continuing good, we made ſail all night with a very gentle Gale; and in the Morning found our ſelves at the Promontory, entring the Bay at <hi>Salona,</hi> now by the <hi>Greeks</hi> called Cape <hi>Pſaroumatia,</hi> or Fiſhes-eye. This Bay was antiently called <hi>Sinus Criſſaeus;</hi> and though <hi>Strabo</hi> ſeemeth to call the whole Gulph ſo in many Places, yet in his Eight Book he maketh the <hi>Sinus Criſſaeus</hi> to begin from this Place; and all, from the <hi>Antirrhium</hi> to the <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> to be the <hi>Mare Alcyonum:</hi> which yet ſometimes he alſo makes part of the <hi>Sinus Criſſaeus.</hi> I doubt this Place of his, is not very correct. But by comparing the ſeveral Places together, I believe, he meant thus: That the <hi>Sinus Corinthiacus</hi> begins at the <hi>Arrexius</hi> Promontory, and the River <hi>Achelous;</hi> That from <hi>Rhium</hi> and <hi>Antirrhium,</hi> it was called <hi>Mare Alcyonum;</hi> of which <hi>Sinus Criſſaeus</hi> was really a part, and not <hi>vice versâ,</hi> the <hi>Mare Alcyonum</hi> a part of it. For he ſaith expreſly, that <hi>Sinus Criſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaeus</hi> begins at this <hi>Streight:</hi> Yet in another place he calls the Northern Bay, at the further end of the Gulph alſo, more peculiarly, <hi>Mare Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyonum;</hi> and that it was called <hi>Sinus Criſſaeus,</hi> or <hi>Criſſaicus, from a Town at the bottom of this Bay;</hi> as there is one there, yet bearing the name of <hi>Criſſa.</hi> I found our modern Maps very erroneous, both in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Situation of the Gulph it ſelf, as of the Places about it. I therefore have endeavoured to make one of this, and the reſt of thoſe Parts of <hi>Greece</hi> I ſaw, according to my own Obſervations; which you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, as you read</p>
            <p>Wherefore turning this Cape, and keeping along the Shore, at our left hand, we paſſed two little Bays, and came to the Ruins of a Town, called by the <hi>Greeks, Pentagi.</hi>
               <note place="margin">PENTAGI.</note> It may probably have been that, which <hi>Pauſanias</hi> calleth <hi>Panthea;</hi>
               <note place="margin">PANTHEA.</note> which, he ſaith, was between <hi>Amphiſſa</hi> and <hi>Naupactus;</hi> and ſaith only, That it had a Temple dedicated to <hi>Venus,</hi> and another to <hi>Diana,</hi> in a thick Grove of Cypreſs, and Pine-trees. The Foundations of the Town remain on a little <hi>Peninſula,</hi> almoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with two little Bays; in the middle of which is a little Church; wherein we found a little Altar, or elſe the <hi>Pedeſtal</hi> of a Statue; with
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:95495:122"/>the Dedication to <hi>Jupiter Reſtitutor,</hi> or the Reſtorer, by <hi>Auruntius No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatus.</hi>

            <p>Near this we ſaw ſeveral Caves, or Grottoes, hewen out of the Rocks: among the reſt, one that had ſerved for a Sepulcher, with five Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for ſo many Bodies to lie in: Which they call the Sepulcher of <hi>Pentagi,</hi> or <hi>Five Saints;</hi> from whence the Place taketh its preſent Name.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Here I found <hi>Cedrus Lyciae;</hi> which I took to be an Hermaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite Plant, between the <hi>Female Savin</hi> and <hi>Juniper;</hi> becauſe it reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth both; and I had not before ſeen that kind of Cedar.</p>

            <p n="3">3. Another Plant I ſaw like <hi>Lamium;</hi> it was but young and tender All that I obſerved about it was this, <hi>viz.</hi> that from a tender and ſtringy Root, riſeth a quadrangular Stalk, ſet at ſeveral diſtances with Leaves, upon a long <hi>ſtrig</hi> or <hi>ſtem,</hi> like <hi>Dead Nettle,</hi> with white Flowers; but
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:95495:123"/>cut at the Edges with rounder Niches. It hath a large black Spot next to the Strig of it; and round about the Edges a border of a Silver-colour; in the middle of which it is full of Veins, mixed confuſedly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and a ſmell very much reſembling Musk. Wherefore I called it <hi>Lamium Moſchatum,</hi> becauſe I find it not deſcribed by any other.</p>
            <p>The next day we came to the bottom of this Bay of <hi>Salona,</hi> in leſs than two hours time; where we were made to pay a Doller a Head for our Welcom on the <hi>Grecian</hi> Shore, by an Infidel that called himſelf, <hi>Receivour of the Cuſtoms;</hi> although we aſſured him, that we were not Merchants; and our due being only to pay <hi>Five Aſpers:</hi> but of that we were inform'd, when it was too late. Upon this Rocky Shore I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved <hi>Spurge</hi> to grow in Trees, with Bodies half a foot <hi>Diameter;</hi> and wild Almond-trees, then in flower.</p>
            <p>Here we took Horſes, which we found upon their Return to <hi>Salona;</hi> and firſt paſſed over a rocky Hill, that led us down into a fertil Plain, well planted with Corn, and Olive-trees; which I ſuppoſe to be that, was called <hi>The happy Plain of Criſſa:</hi> for it lieth under <hi>Criſſa,</hi> which we left upon a Hill on our right hand, about a Mile and half, or two Miles from the Sea towards Mount <hi>Parnaſſus:</hi> thence going through a <hi>Streight,</hi> between a Hill on which <hi>Criſſa</hi> ſtands, on the right hand, and Rocks on the left, brought us into another fair Valley, well planted, till'd, and water'd with a Stream, running through the middle of it, which I ſuppoſe, meets with the <hi>Pleiſtus,</hi> ſomewhere between <hi>Criſſa,</hi> and the Sea; and from thence, into the Bay of <hi>Salona.</hi> This Valley is but nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, being bounded by the Mountain <hi>Corax</hi> South-Weſt, and by the Ridges of <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> North-Eaſt; and after eight or ten Miles riding from Sea, this Valley brought us by Noon to <hi>Salona.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salona</hi> is ſituated upon a Rock in the inmoſt Receſs of this Valley, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a high Mountain Northwards;<note place="margin">SALONA, or AMPHISSA</note> unto which <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> ſtretcheth out a Ridge on one hand, as alſo does Mount <hi>Corax</hi> on the other. On the top of this Rock is the Caſtle, and about it is the Town. The number of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> here, are about equal. It is a Biſhoprick, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Metropolitan of <hi>Athens;</hi> and the <hi>Greeks</hi> have here ſix Churches. The Reverend Biſhop I ſaw upon my return from <hi>Athens,</hi> at the Covent of <hi>Saint Luca.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> have ſeven Moſques: But no <hi>Jews</hi> are permitted here. Their Trade is in ſome Cotton; but chiefly in <hi>Tabaco:</hi> of which fifteen <hi>Okas</hi> are worth but one Dollar. An <hi>Oka</hi> is a weight with them of about Forty two Ounces. We ſaw nothing remarkable of Antiquity here; only a <hi>Roman</hi> Eagle, well cut in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Some have thought this to be the antient <hi>Delphos;</hi> as <hi>Niger,</hi> and <hi>Baudron,</hi> from him. But becauſe this agreed not with the <hi>Idea</hi> we had of the Situation of that Place; we made ſtrict enquiry, whether there were no old Stones with writing upon them, about the Town; and at laſt we heard of one, at a Church on the ſide of the Mountain, a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Mile above the Town; which we went up to ſee. The Church is called <hi>Sotiros Metamorphoſis,</hi> being dedicated to the <hi>Transfiguration</hi> of our Saviour. But the poor <hi>Pappa</hi> ſeeing us come in our <hi>Turkiſh Habit,</hi> was ſo frighted, that he ran, and hid himſelf among the Rocks. But we, unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to loſe our Labour of climbing up ſo high for nothing, ſent our <hi>Greek</hi> to ſeek about for him, and to aſſure him we were <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and not <hi>Turks;</hi>
               <pb n="311" facs="tcp:95495:123"/>and that we came only to make our <hi>Stauroma,</hi> or Sign of the Croſs in his Church; which is a Ceremony of the <hi>Greek</hi> Worſhip, whereby they worſhip God when they come into their Churches, and diſtinguiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> the Enemies of Chriſt's Croſs. Upon this firſt his Wife came forth, who called her Husband, and ſoon confirmed him, that we were Chriſtians, both by our Words and Behaviour. When he had opened the Church, he ſhewed us a large Stone upon the Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, full written in <hi>Latine:</hi> which we copied, although the Letters were ill engraven; for the V Conſonants are form'd like the Old <hi>Greek</hi> Y, and the <hi>Latine</hi> it ſelf corrupt, as you ſee.</p>

            <p>This put it out of queſtion, that <hi>Salona</hi> had been called, in former times, <hi>Amphiſſa,</hi> and not <hi>Delphos:</hi> And beſides, the Situation of this Place agreeth exactly with what <hi>Pauſanias</hi> and <hi>Strabo</hi> have ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Amphiſſa;</hi> which <hi>Delphos</hi> does no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. We requited the <hi>Pappa</hi> with ſome <hi>Timins;</hi> who would needs make us taſte of his White Wine, which was exceeding good: ſo with great ſatisfaction we returned. By the way we came to a Fountain, which our Guide aſſured us, had a Stone written at the further end; for it went in a good way under ground, like an <hi>Aqueduct.</hi> We were in hopes to have found here the Inſcription, that was commanded by the <hi>Proconſul</hi> to be written, and ſet up, as is aboveſaid. But my Comrade found it not, although he went with a Candle up to the Knees in Water, to ſeek for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amphiſſa</hi> was the chief City of <hi>Locrii Ozelorum. Strabo</hi> ſaith, That in his time it was deſtroyed, or lay waſte: But <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> who was after him, deſcribeth its Temples, and other Buildings, and Monuments. Moreover, our Inſcription, which is of later Date, ſhews it to have been again inhabited. It had its Name from the Nymph <hi>Amphiſſa,</hi> with whom <hi>Apollo</hi> had to do: and her Monument was the chief Ornament of the Town: Next to which, that of <hi>Andremon,</hi> and his Wife <hi>Gorga,</hi> had the Preheminence. <hi>Minerva</hi> had a Temple in the Caſtle, which is the ſame the <hi>Turks</hi> now have; and her Image was thought by the Inhabitants, to have been brought from <hi>Troy.</hi> But <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> a great Judge in theſe Antiquities, thought it rather from the Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Work, to be of <hi>Rhoecus,</hi> and <hi>Theodorus</hi> of <hi>Samos</hi> his doing; who firſt taught the Art of Founding Metals, but were not accounted the moſt excellent Workmen. Here was alſo a Temple of the <hi>Anactes,</hi> Protectors of Infants, that ſome take to be <hi>Cabires;</hi> others, <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux;</hi> others, the <hi>Dioſcouri,</hi> or <hi>Curetes, viz.</hi> thoſe that looked unto <hi>Jupiter,</hi> when he was an Infant. And indeed it would be a wonder, could they accommodate all their Gods to be the ſame under ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Names, Stories, Birth-places, Sepulchers, and Circumſtances; when from their different Names, they were all rather to be judged different Perſons; proper Names being uſually the ſame in all Languages, with ſome ſmall difference. We heard of no ſuch Place as <hi>Lambina;</hi> which <hi>Niger</hi> takes to have been <hi>Amphiſſa:</hi> and believe it to be another of his Errours.</p>
            <p>This night we lodged with a <hi>Greek,</hi> called <hi>Georgaki Andreno.</hi> We had a Letter from <hi>Signior Samuel</hi> of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> to a <hi>Turk,</hi> called <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met Baſha,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Tuniſino,</hi> from the Place he came from: But he not being at home, a Relation of his ſent us to an honeſt, and merry <hi>Greek;</hi> who made us all the welcome he could, and provided us a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, not ungrateful to our travelling Stomachs. But we had like to have over-ſawc'd it with Wine; for out good Hoſt would not let the Bowl ſtand ſtill; it being the <hi>Greek</hi> Mode to make the Cup go round without ceaſing: Nor was it Manners on our ſide to refuſe it, or call for Wine out of our turns.</p>
            <pb n="313" facs="tcp:95495:124"/>
            <p>Being now well aſſured, that <hi>Salona</hi> was not <hi>Delphos,</hi> but the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſſa</hi> of old; we enquired of our Hoſt, whether there were no anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Ruins of a Town in our way between this and <hi>Livadia?</hi> He told us, That there were many at <hi>Caſtri,</hi> a Village about mid-way: So we ſpake with ſeveral Janizaries to conduct us thither, and thence to <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vadia</hi> and <hi>Thebes.</hi> But not agreeing upon the Price, we took the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Mahomet Baſha,</hi> and parted very early next Morning. For Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Spon</hi>'s going into the Water at the Fountain, above the Town, had made ſome of the <hi>Turks</hi> to murmur, and to ſuſpect us to be Spies.</p>
            <p>A little way from the Town we foorded a Brook, which joyns with the other Stream in the Plain; but are both near loſt in watering them, before they come to the Sea. After a Mile or two Riding, we looked about, and ſaw another <hi>Janizary</hi> following us, of thoſe we had ſpoken to over night: which we were reſolved to keep alſo; thinking, until we were better acquainted with the Country, we could not be too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. So we were now eight ſtrong; <hi>viz.</hi> our two Janizaries, our <hi>Greek,</hi> our three <hi>Hagoiaties,</hi> or Guides, who were the owners of our Horſes, Monſieur <hi>Spon,</hi> and my ſelf. We ſoon began to mount the Ridges of the Mountain <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> by a very bad rough way, South-Eaſtwards, until we arrived, in four or five Hours time, at <hi>Caſtri;</hi>
               <note place="margin">CASTRI. DELPHOS.</note> which we no ſooner approached, but we concluded, that it was undoubtedly the Remainder of the famous City of <hi>Delphos.</hi>

               <hi>Caſtri,</hi> or <hi>Delphos,</hi> is ſituate on the South-ſide of the Mountain <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſus,</hi> ſomething inclining to the Weſt; not on the top, nor at the foot of the Mountain: for it hath a great way to the Plains of <hi>Criſſa</hi> below it, and much more to the Mountains above it. The high Cliffs in ſight above it from the Town, ſeem to end in two points; whence I judged it was call'd of old, <hi>Biceps Parnaſſus:</hi> For it hath many more tops,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:95495:125"/>and much higher than theſe, being a very great Mountain: But theſe two tops ſeen from <hi>Delphos,</hi> hide all the reſt. Between which the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter falls, in great abundance, after Rain or Snow, and hath worn them almoſt aſunder. There is alſo a Fountain, with a very plentiful Source of Water, continually iſſuing out from among thoſe Rocks, juſt under that Separation: which by the Marble Steps deſcending to it, and the Niches made in the Rock for Statues above it,<note place="margin">CASTALIA.</note> ſhould be the Fountain <hi>Caſtalia,</hi> that ſo inſpired the antient Poets.

            <p>I need not tell you what this Place was in antient times: All the World knows, how famous <hi>Delphos</hi> hath been for the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> there, conſulted for ſo many Ages together. But its antient Glory is now vaniſhed; and it remains Great, at preſent, only in the Writings of the Antients. Before we entred within the Compaſs of the (former) Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we obſerved ſeveral Grottoes cut in the Rocks, with ſeveral Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, as we conceived, to bury the Dead; as believing, that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Sanctity, and Reſpect had to this Place, would not permit to bury the Dead within the Walls; no more than at <hi>Delos,</hi> the other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Oracle of <hi>Apollo.</hi> Mounting a little higher, by a way cut out of the Rocks, we entred through a Paſſage, where we thought the antient Gates might have been: from whence we ſaw the Town of <hi>Caſtri</hi> hard by; and deſcending thence a little further, we went into a Church on the right hand, called S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Helias;</hi> where we found the laſt, and ſome other pieces of white Marble, with Inſcriptions on them. At the Door of this Church is another great Stone, with ſome Lines of an Inſcription, which we copied as well as we could, and where I thought, that I read the Name of <hi>Delphos</hi> again. This ſeems to be the Place moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> to have been ſituated in; although now no
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:95495:125"/>Remains of it are to be found: only <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſaith, That it was in the upper Part of the City. It is true, there is a Rock yet higher, North-Weſt of this, beyond the <hi>Stadium.</hi> But there is no room for ſuch a Temple to be built there, nor any manner of antient Remains on it; but where this Church is built, the Ground lieth higher than the reſt, and ſquare, having the Foundations of a Wall, built of hewen Stone, and towards the Deſcent of the Hill ſupported by Buttrices; but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the way-ſide, even with the Ground. Not far from this are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Antient pieces of Walls, with arched, and old vaulted Places.</p>
            <p>A little further on the left hand of the way, is the Place, where a <hi>Stadium</hi> hath been; and ſome of the Degrees yet remain of white Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It is much leſs, than that of <hi>Athens;</hi> although both had the ſame Founder, viz. <hi>Herodes Atticus.</hi> The <hi>Stadium</hi> hath the high Rock I laſt ſpake of, at one Corner Weſt of it; towards which are ſeveral Grot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes and Caves hewn out of it, I ſuppoſe, for Sepulchers, as well as thoſe we ſaw, coming into the Town. This way led us a little more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by an eaſie Deſcent, to the Inhabited Parts of <hi>Caſtri;</hi> and we alighted at a large Houſe, that ſerved for a <hi>Kan,</hi> or Place of Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to Paſſengers. This Town conſiſts of not above Two hundred Houſes, and thoſe very ill built. The <hi>Turks</hi> are not above a dozen in number, and have one <hi>Moſque.</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> have five or ſix Churches, and ſeem very good People, though poor; and were very civil to us. The little Trade they have, is in Cotton and Tabaco; and their Wine is exceeding good. <hi>Caſtri</hi> belongeth to a <hi>Timar,</hi> called <hi>Abd-Haga,</hi> who liveth at <hi>Salona. Timarlicks</hi> are a kind of <hi>Fee-farms,</hi> that belong to the <hi>Grand Signior:</hi> and thoſe that hold them of him, are obliged to ſerve him in the War, according to their Revenue.</p>
            <p>After Noon we went through the Town to the Fountain, we knew to be <hi>Caſtalia,</hi> by <hi>Pauſanias</hi> his Deſcription of it; who coming the way contrary to us, to wit, from the <hi>Gymnaſium,</hi> and <hi>Boeotia</hi> wards, left it at his right hand. It is juſt in the Cleft of the Rocks, as I ſaid before, hanging over it with a high Precipice. In this Rock, above the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, is a kind of little Chapel, dedicated to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>John;</hi> and above that thre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Niches for Statues; one great one in the middle, and two leſſer on each ſide. In this Cleft, about nine or ten Yards high, is a hole; which by throwing Stones into it, we found to have Water in it: and on the right hand I obſerved ſome Stairs, leading up to it, cut out of the Rock; but ſo broken, that there was no clambering up. We judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this to be the <hi>Antrum Corycium,</hi> or the Grotto of the Nymphs, the Poets called by that Name. I believe this makes a fine <hi>Caſcade,</hi> when there is Water enough falling from the Mountains. The Water of <hi>Caſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> is very good and cool; fit to quench the Thirſt of thoſe hot-headed Poets, who, in their <hi>Bacchanals,</hi> ſpare neither God nor Man; and to whom nothing is ſo ſacred, but they will venture to profane it.</p>
            <p>Continuing yet upon a Deſcent, we came to a Monaſtery, called <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagia,</hi> its Church being dedicated to the Bleſſed Virgin. It is ſituated upon the Brink of the Mountain, upon ground, held up by antient, ſtrong Walls of hewn Stone. There we ſaw ſeveral Capitals, and Fuſts, of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian</hi> Pillars, and other Fragments of Antiquity; among which three or four Inſcriptions, in and about the Church, and the Name of <hi>Delphos,</hi>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:95495:126"/>with only theſe words in the Pavement of the Church,
ΔΕΛΦΩΝ ΠΩΛΕΩΣ ΑΠ ΕΛΕΥΘΕΡΟΥ.
Others we copied there alſo, which I reſerve for another occaſion. Here are not above three or four <hi>Caloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> belonging to this Monaſtery; who brought us of their Bread, and very good White Wine. We wondered, that one of them knew, that this Place was antiently called <hi>Delphos;</hi> which he told us, he found by ſome Book he had read: For it is not uſual, that they know any thing of the Hiſtory of their Country. But he was much pleaſed, when we ſhewed him the Name written in his Church. We believed, that this Place was where the <hi>Gymnaſium,</hi> or Schools ſtood, from <hi>Pauſanias</hi> his words: <hi>Thoſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that go up from the</hi> Gymnaſium <hi>to the Temple, have the Fountain</hi> Caſtalia <hi>on the right hand.</hi> But we, bending our Steps contrary to his, ought to leave it, as we did, on our left hand. Thence is a great Precipice, in which the River <hi>Pleiſtos</hi> runneth; which <hi>Pauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> makes three <hi>Stadia,</hi> or about Four hundred Paces below: Into which, what the Town and Gardens can ſpare of <hi>Caſtalia,</hi> deſcends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. Returning by the Fountain, we obſerved a great piece of the Rock tumbled down, and almoſt buried: on one ſide of it, that lay a little hollow, we ſaw Letters written in large, but ſtrange Characters, ſo as we could not make any thing of them.</p>
            <p>We returned to our lodging very well pleaſed with our days labour, although weary with rambling up and down upon thoſe Rocks. Being returned, whilſt Supper was making ready, I began to put my Plants I had gathered, in order into my Book; among the reſt I found one, which was ſomething like <hi>narrow leav'd Bugloſs,</hi> in ſhape and manner of growing;<note place="margin">PLANTS. of PARNASSUS.</note> the leaves long, criſped, and rough, growing one above another upon a Stalk of a foot high. Between each leaf is a yellow Flower, like <hi>Bugloſs</hi> in ſhape; which is followed by ſeeds, five toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the bottom of a Cup. The whole Plant is ſo viſcous, or clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that it ſticketh to ones fingers, and is of a very ſtrong ſweet ſmell, like <hi>Narciſſus junei folio;</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> call <hi>Junculle. Monſieur Merchant,</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> called this, <hi>Stachys</hi> Viſcoſa, <hi>flore luteo.</hi> In the Cleft of the Rocks I found another Plant, with a leaf ſomething like <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rola,</hi> which he called <hi>Petromarula Gretica,</hi> or <hi>Lactuca petraea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The beſt, and readieſt way from hence to <hi>Livadia</hi> is, to paſs by the Fountain <hi>Caſtalia,</hi> by the Monaſtery; and ſo ſtill keeping under the Mountains, between <hi>Cirphis</hi> and <hi>Parnaſſus;</hi> for thus it is but half a Days journey from <hi>Delphos</hi> to <hi>Livadia.</hi> But we could not paſs by this Mountain, ſo celebrated by the Poets, without paſſing over it to ſee what Beauties thoſe really were, they ſo much commend in it. And therefore we took our Guide we had the Day before; who willingly offered us his ſervice, being well acquainted with this Mountain, and a fellow naturally ingenious, as moſt of the Greeks are. We paſſed between the <hi>Stadium,</hi> and the Clefts above the Town, and preſently began to mount, making many turns backward and forward, to get a little ground in height. But I being light, made no great matter of it, chuſing rather to go on foot, and have my Horſe led, than to venture my Neck by a ſtumble. So croſſing all the ways, I had often time to ſit down, before my Comrades came to me, to view the Plains of <hi>Salona,</hi> and the Gulph of <hi>Lepanto</hi> below me. The way is, in ſome places, cut
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:95495:126"/>into Stairs, in the Rock; which ſeem very antient. I obſerved alſo a kind of Chanel cut in the Rock, in a ſtreight Line downwards; which, I believe, hath been an <hi>Aqueduct;</hi> but now ſpoiled. We were a long Hour, before we got to the Top; whereon is a pretty large Plain. We turned to the right hand, to ſee the two Tops of the Mountain above <hi>Delphos;</hi> and from the Weſtern one, I had an excellent Proſpect over the Gulph of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> the Mountains of <hi>Morea;</hi> and nearer the Gulph it ſelf, South, South-Weſt and Weſt, until the Mountain <hi>Corax:</hi> and yet nearer hand, Mount <hi>Cirphis,</hi> now called <hi>Stiva,</hi> from a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery that is on it, ſo called. The height of this Top makes Mount <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phis</hi> look from hence like a Plain, on the Top, and is a kind of <hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneſus;</hi> the Bay of <hi>Salona</hi> being on one ſide of it, and another Bay called <hi>Aſproſpiti,</hi> on the other ſide: of which, more hereafter.</p>
            <p>Hence I took the Figure of the Bay of <hi>Salona,</hi> with all the Iſlands in it; which ſeem'd to lie before me like a Map. Between this, and the other Top, in view from <hi>Caſtri,</hi> is a deep Precipice, where the Water runs down to <hi>Caſtalia.</hi> How large it may be within, I know not; yet I doubt not, but it may have room enough to be the <hi>Antrum Corycium.</hi> I conceiv'd, that <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Temple was not far from this Place; but I found no <hi>Remains</hi> of it any where. Here are now only ſome Shepherds Hutts; and the Place they call <hi>Alona.</hi> Turning back to our way-ward, we had the view of the higheſt Part of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> as high again as we had yet mounted: Towards which, we paſſed a high Hill, covered with thoſe kind of Pines I deſcribed on <hi>Olympus:</hi> where we ſometimes paſſed over, and ſometimes through Snow; and left a Lake on our left hand, made by the melting of the Snow and Rain. But beyond that is an extream high Point of the Mountain, all covered with Snow; which <hi>Pauſanias</hi> had ſome reaſon to ſay, is <hi>almoſt above the Clouds.</hi> It was on this Top, that it is ſaid, <hi>Deucalion</hi> ſaved himſelf, and his Wife <hi>Pyrrha,</hi> from the Flood that happened in his time: which Place of Retreat he found by the howling of Wolves; and therefore called the Town he built there, <hi>Lycoria.</hi> They call it now, as my Companion ſaith, <hi>Lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coura.</hi> I underſtood it <hi>Hiliocoro:</hi> and ſhould have thought my ſelf mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken by the Article <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but that he, who told it me, gave me the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its Name, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it ſhines ſo bright afar off; like the Sun, which they call <hi>Hilios:</hi> adding the Termination <hi>Coro,</hi> to make it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the <hi>the Village of the Sun.</hi> However it be, both the one, and the other retains ſtill ſomething of the ſound of the old Name. On this Top of the Mountain, <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſaith, it was, that the <hi>Thyades</hi> ſacrificed to <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Apollo,</hi> inſpired with a ſacred Rage. We came to the foot of this high Top, through a large Valley of about four or five Miles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, and reſted our ſelves at a Fountain they call <hi>Droſinigo.</hi> It hath one of the plentifulleſt Sources of Water, I ever ſaw; and is much to be wondred at, conſidering the height we were yet from the plain Ground. For although this is a Valley in reſpect to the Tops of the Mountains all about it, much higher than it; yet is it a Mountain in reſpect of <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes,</hi> and <hi>Delphos</hi> a Mountain in reſpect of the Plains of <hi>Criſſa.</hi> Yet the Source of this Fountain boileth up continually a foot <hi>Diameter,</hi> and near a foot high, from the Surface of the reſt of the Water; and preſently maketh a little River, which goes, and diſcharges it ſelf into a Lake, made
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:95495:127"/>by it, a quarter of a Mile diſtant, South-Eaſt of it, in the Plain. The Water of the Fountain <hi>Droſinigo,</hi> is as good and cool, as that at <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Parting from this Fountain, we kept along its Stream, until we came to the Lake; which we ſtill kept on the right hand of us, till we came to the Eaſtern end of it. We could find no Paſſage for the Water out of it, but one; being a Hole pierced through a great Rock, at the Eaſt end; which is backed with a high Hill. We perceiv'd no Water then to run through the Paſſage, whereby it uſed to run, being ſtop't with Dirt, and Buſhes: But there was a ſufficient ſign, that it uſed to run, when the Lake, through the melting of Snow, or rains, is fuller of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And, I believe, its ordinary Paſſage is deeper under the Gravel, or at leaſt through it: For they ſay, It appeareth again below <hi>Delphos;</hi> and the Place, with the Rivulet it makes, they call <hi>Scizaliza.</hi> Were it not for ſuch Subterraneous Paſſages as theſe, the whole Valley would ſoon be filled with Water, until it ran over the Tops of the Rocks, down upon <hi>Delphos.</hi> And, poſſibly, it might be one natural Reaſon of that Deluge, or Flood, in <hi>Deucalion</hi>'s time; and that he could ſave himſelf only upon that higheſt Point of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> called antiently <hi>Lycoria.</hi> For indeed I eſteem this Mountain, not only the higheſt in all <hi>Greece;</hi> but one of the higheſt in all the World, and not inferiour to Mount <hi>Cenis</hi> amongſt the <hi>Alpes.</hi> It is ſeen very plain from <hi>Corinth.</hi> But I cannot, with my Comrade, eſteem it eighty Miles diſtant, unleſs it were to be meaſured by Land, over the Mountains and Valleys. For M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Vernon,</hi> who took the Latitude both of <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Delphos,</hi> placeth this in Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eight Degrees, fifty Minutes; and the other in Thirty eight Degrees, fourteen Minutes: ſo that the difference is only Thirty ſix Minutes La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. And for the Longitude, it is the ſame; it ſtanding directly North of <hi>Corinth;</hi> which I took with a Compaſs, in the Caſtle of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</hi> So that by the common Calcule of <hi>Degrees</hi> and <hi>Minutes,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be above ſix or ſeven and thirty Miles off, in a direct Line. But there are ſuch high Mountains, and deep Valleys between, as may make it near as much more, for ought I know. But it is ſeen ſo plain from thence, that if it had the advantage of being ſeparated from other Mountains, I doubt not, that it would be ſeen further than Mount <hi>Athos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rambling up and down the Rocks, to look over, and have a good Proſpect, in which I ſtill took great pleaſure, I came at laſt to a place, where I could look down the moſt prodigious Precipice I ever ſaw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this and Mount <hi>Cirphis.</hi>

            <p>After this I returned, and came to the Brink of the Mountain, South-Eaſtward, which we deſcended, by a dangerous and ſteep way; and in two hours, arrived at a Village called <hi>Aracovi,</hi> or <hi>Racovi;</hi>
               <note place="margin">RACOVI, or ARACOVI.</note> which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout midway down on the ſide of the Mountain.

The reſt of their Habit is a looſe Veſt of White Woollen. They are all Shepherds, and Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes, who feed their Sheep on the Mountains.

            <p>In one Church we found ſome Fragments of Antiquity, <hi>viz.</hi> of Marble Pillars and <hi>Corinthian</hi> Capitals; which made us think, that this was a Place of ſome Antiquity. My Companion judges, it was that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently called <hi>Amphryſſus,</hi> or otherwiſe <hi>Ambryſus.</hi> But he muſt pardon me, if I am not of his Opinion.

It is in this way, that <hi>Racovi</hi> ſtandeth, about four. Miles from <hi>Caſtri;</hi> and, I believe, more from <hi>Daulis,</hi> now called <hi>Dalia</hi> Eaſtwards. He ſaith moreover, That one going from <hi>Amphryſſus</hi> to <hi>Anticyrrha,</hi> muſt aſcend <hi>Two Stadia.</hi> But from <hi>Racovi</hi> is no Aſcent, but up the Mount <hi>Parnaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus:</hi> Every way towards the Seaward, there is firſt a conſiderable Deſcent. But to proceed.</p>
            <p>The next Morning we parted from <hi>Racovi</hi> by Day-break, and deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded yet further half an hour, upon the Brow of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> by near as ill a way as we had paſſed the day before in coming to it; only we kept ſtill forward, and did not return backward and forward. At laſt we came to the bottom, between the Mountains; from whence is yet a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent two ways, both towards the <hi>South-Eaſt,</hi> and <hi>North-Weſt.</hi> As we paſſed, I obſerv'd abundance of Springs to iſſue out of the Mountain, and collect themſelves in the bottom, between <hi>Cirphis</hi> and <hi>Parnaſſus:</hi> ſome of them running towards the Gulph of <hi>Salona,</hi> or <hi>Criſſa,</hi> by the Towns <hi>Caſtri</hi> and <hi>Criſſa,</hi> making the River <hi>Pleiſtus;</hi> whoſe Fountain ariſeth in this bottom, not a Bow-ſhot from another Spring, which runs contrary to it; to wit, towards <hi>Livadia,</hi> and ſo to the Lake <hi>Copais.</hi> Hence we yet deſcended ſtill South-Eaſt, by the way <hi>Schiſtis,</hi> between the two Mountains; but much better than before, along this laſt Stream; which grew bigger, and ſometimes loſt it ſelf among the Stones and Gravel. I believe it was antiently called <hi>Triton;</hi>
               <note place="margin">TRITON.</note> which, with the River <hi>Melas,</hi> did take their Riſe in the <hi>Phocaean</hi> Mountains. Two hours riding from <hi>Racovi,</hi> we came into a Plain between thoſe Mountains, which <hi>Pauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> takes notice of for their being ſo well planted with Vines, and a certain Shrub, like to <hi>Rhamnus;</hi> which the <hi>Ionians,</hi> he ſaith, call <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. I did not take parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular notice of its growing here, having already obſerv'd it upon Mount <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> and abundance of other Places all over <hi>Greece.</hi> But <hi>Pauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> ſaith, That it was here particularly cultivated, and ſet among the Vines; and in the ſame Order with them, by the <hi>Amphryſians.</hi> The Mountains that encompaſs this Plain, are <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> North and North-Eaſt, <hi>Cirphis</hi> Weſt, <hi>Helicon</hi> Eaſt and South; with ſome other high crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy Rocks South, and South-Weſt, making the Eaſtern ſide of the Bay of <hi>Aſproſiti:</hi> Where I believe <hi>Anticyrrha</hi> was formerly, and thence the Promontory <hi>Pharygion.</hi> But of this more hereafter.</p>
            <pb n="321" facs="tcp:95495:128"/>
            <p>When we were come into this Plain, we left the way to <hi>Livadia,</hi> and turned to the right hand Southward; and near our way, alſo on the right hand, we found an old Town deſtroyed, with two old Churches, and a Caſtle, all lying in Ruins. In one of the Churches, within a Niche, by the Altar, is an Inſcription; but ſo worn out, we could not make any thing of it. I ſuppoſe this was <hi>Amphryſſus:</hi> For it is between <hi>Stiria</hi> and <hi>Aſproſpiti;</hi> which I gueſs to be <hi>Anticyrrha,</hi> agreeing with <hi>Pauſanias</hi> his Deſcription. Returning to our way, we came to another Stream, which runneth towards the <hi>Triton;</hi> but is ſwallowed up by a Paſſage under ground in its way, as I obſerved returning from S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Luca</hi> the laſt time. About the middle of the Plain we croſſed a way, that goeth from <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſpiti</hi> to <hi>Livadia;</hi> and ſo proceeding, we left a Village, as my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion ſaith, called <hi>Stiri,</hi> and came to a Deſart Place, by a narrow way, with Precipices on each ſide; which by little and little, enlargeth it ſelf into a good big Hill, like a <hi>Peninſula,</hi> having a deep Valley almoſt round about, bounded by the high Cliffs of the Mountain <hi>Zagara,</hi> as they now call the <hi>Helicon,</hi> encompaſſing both this Hill, and the Valley about it, with Tops covered with Snow as high as the Clouds.</p>
            <p>Upon the Brow of this Hill, on the South-Eaſt-ſide,<note place="margin">St. LUCE. STIRIA.</note> is ſituated the Convent of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Luke,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Stiriotes,</hi> from this Hill ſo called alſo. They do not mean S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Luke</hi> the Evangeliſt; but another, a Hermite of this Deſart: which we found by the Office we ſaw, and they uſe in their Church; where the Title of <hi>Stiriotes</hi> is given him. This is one of the fineſt Convents in all <hi>Greece,</hi> and conſiſts ordinarily of above a Hundred and fifty Perſons; of which ſome they call <hi>Hieromonachi;</hi> who are in Orders, and only attend upon the Service of God, and ſome other Employment in their Cells, as knitting of Caps, and other neceſſary Affairs. The Seniors of theſe have a young one to wait on them, whom they teach to write, and read, and to ſay his Office. If he have any Ingenuity, he proceeds to underſtand to ſay their Liturgies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The others are called <hi>Caloiros;</hi> and are employed about all ſervile and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Offices about the Convent; ſome of them tilling the Ground, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers keeping the Sheep; and are commonly ſeen up and down in the Fields, about that buſineſs: only Sundays and Holy-days they meet all together in the Church. Out of the Seniors, the <hi>Abbots,</hi> whom they call <hi>Hegoumenoes,</hi> are choſen every ſecond Year. The preſent <hi>Abbot</hi> is named <hi>Gregorio;</hi> who is a good ingenious Man, and underſtands the antient <hi>Greek</hi> indifferently well. The Valley round about them belongs to the Convent, and bears good Wine, Oyl, Corn, and Honey. They have ſeveral little Huts up and down, where the <hi>Caloiros</hi> lodge near their Buſineſs; and theſe they call <hi>Metochia,</hi> the ſame word, which the antient <hi>Greeks</hi> uſed for a Colony. Out of this they have a conſiderable Revenue: but of late are ſo impoveriſhed by ſome ſcarce Years, that they have been forced to ſell their Church-plate, to pay the <hi>Turk</hi> his dues; which is Two hundred Dollers a Year, or about fifty Pounds <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The reſt of their Livelihood is Charity; which cannot be much in Money, out of the Miſery that poor People are brought into. They have been likewiſe, ſome Years ago, much moleſted by the <hi>Turks;</hi> who came in companies, plundred them, miſuſed them, and ſome of them they kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; ſo that the Convent was well near deſtroyed: and, at laſt, they
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:95495:129"/>were forced to flee to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to complain of the unſupportable Violences, againſt their Priviledges, obtained even from the <hi>Turks</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Upon which they had a <hi>Turk</hi> granted them, to protect them from the like Outrages; whom they are obliged to maintain, and pay.</p>
            <p>We had the Company of the <hi>Hegoumenos</hi> a good while; and among other things we asked him, Who was the Founder of their Convent? Who told us, That it was the Emperour <hi>Romanus,</hi> Son to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Seventh, and Grand-Son to <hi>Leon,</hi> called the <hi>Philoſopher:</hi> and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us an old Book, that ſpake of the Building of it; and carried us down into a Vault of the Church, and ſhewed us two Tombs; which, he ſaid, were the Tombs of this Emperour, and his Empreſs. My Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade then called to mind an Inſcription, that we copied from the Walls of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that ſpeaketh of a Church built by the Emperour <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus;</hi> which we ſhould never have judged to have been this, had not this good Abbot aſſured us, That it was built by the ſame Emperour, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus.</hi> All of the Inſcription that remains perfect, is this you here ſee; and, perhaps, there is not much wanting.</p>

            <p>That is to ſay, The great Emperour, <hi>Romanus,</hi> hath built a very great Church for all the <hi>Greeks;</hi> and this Tower from the Foundation. Where the word <hi>Romaiois</hi> ought to be tranſlated <hi>Greeks:</hi> For ſince the Seat of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was removed from <hi>Italy</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople, Greece</hi> hath been called <hi>Romania,</hi> and now more corruptedly <hi>Romelia;</hi> and the <hi>Greeks</hi> commonly call themſelves <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And truly, this is the fineſt Church I ſaw in all <hi>Greece,</hi> next to <hi>Santa Sophia</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> notwithſtanding it is old, and hath ſuffered very much by Earthquakes, and Time. It is built after the <hi>Greek</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, almoſt ſquare; without, it hath a Portico at the Weſt end: From which are three Doors, to enter into the Church. Then there is an indifferent large <hi>Cuppalo</hi> in the middle; and is proportioned within, in the ſhape of a Croſs. All the Walls are caſed with poliſhed Marble, and the Pavement laid with Marble of ſeveral colours, and <hi>Jaſper</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry,</hi> &amp;c. The Roof and <hi>Cuppalo</hi> is adorned with antient Moſaick Work, in Figures of our Saviour, the Bleſſed Virgin, and others; with a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery round about it, ſuſtained by Marble Pillars. We obſerved alſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Planks of Tranſparent Marble; of which Monſieur <hi>Gulitier,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman, hath made ſuch Wonders in his Account of <hi>Athens:</hi> All the Myſtery is, That the Marble being cut in thin Planks, and withal, being of it ſelf a little Tranſparent, the Light looketh a little yellow through it. Adjoyning to this, on the South-ſide, is another little Church, dedicated to the Holy Virgin; which hath a pretty <hi>Portico,</hi> ſuſtained by two <hi>Corinthian</hi> Pillars, with their beautiful Chapiters on them. Hard by it is another, which is above in an upper Room, dedicated to <hi>Saint Sopito.</hi> Hither they bring their Sick to lodge; and ſay, They are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:95495:129"/>cured miraculouſly. There we found a Fragment of an Inſcription; and about the Walls of the Church, and Convent, ſeveral others. Thoſe that were not out of the reach of our Eyes, we copied. One of which is the Dedication of a Fountain, and its <hi>Ducts of Water</hi> to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, amongſt the Gods, and to the City, by one <hi>Xenocrates</hi> and <hi>Euma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridas,</hi> at their own Charges: But the Name of the City is not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>

            <p>I believe, that here might be the antient <hi>Stiria;</hi> if it be not that Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage we paſt by, not far from the Convent: For here is room enough for a little City: and, I ſuppoſe, my Comrade did not obſerve the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of a Wall on the Top of this Hill, as I did another time; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, the Ruins underneath, in the Valley, North of it, which they call <hi>Palaeo-Stiri,</hi> or <hi>Old Stiria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Covent it ſelf ſeemeth to have been built out of more antient Ruins; and I obſerv'd many Pillars of gray Marble lying up and down there, and other antient hewn Stones. Their Accommodation for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and Strangers, is indifferent good, conſidering the Country; and they receive them with as great Civility, and Kindneſs, as the Grand Charter-houſe, near <hi>Grenoble,</hi> in the <hi>Alps,</hi> doth: though they want their great Revenues, and Proſperity. They ſent for a good Lamb from the Fold, and killed it for us; and beſide, with Rice, Chickens, good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lives, Cheeſe, Bread, and Wine, they gave us a moſt hearty and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Welcome. Their Cells are little arched Rooms of Stone, and every one hath one to himſelf. Their manner of living is the ſame with all the <hi>Greek</hi> Monks, uſing ſevere Faſting in their Lents, and never eating Fleſh at any time. They riſe three hours before day to their Morning-Service: Three hours after Sun-riſing, is their Communion-Service; and two hours before night, their Evening-Service, or Veſpers. They have other Books alſo, they read between, at ſet Hours, in private. They told us alſo, That they had many <hi>Manuſcripts;</hi> but we ſaw only ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ones, as of Service-Books, Evangeliſts, Saints Lives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The beſt of which was that of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Coſmas,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Damianus;</hi> with which were joyned the Lives of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Matthew,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Philip,</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, upon Vellom well written. When I return'd thither afterwards, I ſaw the Works of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Chryſoſtome;</hi> which then was in a Fathers Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; who read it, and underſtands the antient <hi>Greek</hi> pretty well. It is fair written, and by the hand ſhould be about five or ſix hundred Years old. They pretend to have others of their own, which I could not be permitted to ſee; and ſome that belong'd to the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Athens.</hi> An Evangeliſtary I bought, written in Capital Letters; but as
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:95495:130"/>to the Age, I hope to give a better Account another time. They eat all together in a Hall; round which are long Tables of white Marble, where they ſit according to Seniority; and at the upper end is a little one, where the <hi>Hegoumenos</hi> ſits alone in a Chair. They have ſeveral Offices, and Ceremonies, before and after Dinner. At that after Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I was preſent, when I returned this way, and is thus: When all have dined, and are riſen, before they depart the Room, there is a piece of Bread brought in a diſh, and a cup of Wine ſet upon the <hi>Hegoumeno</hi>'s Table; which by Prayers he ſeems to Conſecrate, like the Sacrament; and then brings it round the Hall: firſt the Bread; of which every one breaketh a Crumb, as they ſtand ranked from one end of the Hall to the other, on each ſide. Then the Wine is brought in like manner, and every one drinketh of it round. After which ſome Prayers and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings are ſaid; and then every one departeth to his Cell. The next day, after Morning-Service, the <hi>Hegoumenos</hi> carried us into a kind of Buttery, as I may call it, and made us breakfaſt with him, with Bread and Honey, and Olives, good Wine and <hi>Aqua Vitae.</hi> He told us then, amongſt other things, That the Ambaſſadour of <hi>France,</hi> Monſieur <hi>De Nantuille,</hi> was there ſeveral days, and would fain have had the <hi>Roman Maſs</hi> ſaid in their Church. But they told him, It was a thing they could by no means grant, it being contrary to their Rites. But he yet preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, they at laſt abſolutely refuſed it; letting him know, that if ſuch a thing ſhould be done, they could no more ſay their Liturgy in that Church. At which the Ambaſſadour was very much offended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great Zelot for the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, who made it his Buſineſs every where to perſwade the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that their Belief is the ſame with the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> ſome few Punctilioes only excepted. But they then had had no News of the Council held by the Patriarch, and ſome of the Biſhops, by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance; and the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> was altogether unknown to them, as I before ſaid.</p>
            <p>There was then a young Father, that ſpake very good <hi>Italian,</hi> being a Native of <hi>Zant:</hi> He was our Interpreter; and when we parted with the <hi>Hegoumenos,</hi> he carried us to ſee their Proviſions of <hi>Wine,</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lives,</hi> which they preſerve in the longeſt Casks I ever ſaw; ſeveral of them I meaſured, near twenty foot long. <hi>Olives</hi> pickled are their great Suſtenance in Lent; which are not pickled green, as in theſe Parts; but when they are full ripe, and full of Oyl. They eat them with Vinegar, being very nouriſhing, and wholſome Food, and very grateful to the Stomach.</p>
            <p>There is an Hermite, that liveth a Mile and half off, whom I ſaw not this time; but when I laſt came that way, the <hi>April</hi> enſuing, we went to his Hermitage,<note place="margin">THE HERMITAGE</note> deſcending from the Convent, down the Hill South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; firſt paſſing a little River in a pleaſant Plain, well planted with Vineyards and Olive-trees; and among them, little Houſes, where the <hi>Caloyers</hi> come ſometimes for Recreation, in the Summer. After this we mounted up by a ſteep Rock, by an eaſie Aſcent, in a way cut out of the Rock, and large enough for two Carts to paſs by one another; on the top of which we diſcerned the antient Ruins of a Caſtle, and a Town. This I believe to be that, <hi>Pauſanias</hi> calleth <hi>Bulis,</hi> in the Confines of <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> and <hi>Boeotia,</hi> ſeven <hi>Stadia,</hi> or almoſt a Mile from the Port; for there
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:95495:130"/>is a Harbour about the ſame diſtance from the Place; and was, without doubt, that which <hi>Strabo</hi> calleth <hi>Mycus Portus,</hi> the laſt Port of the <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caeans;</hi> beyond which the Rocks of Mount <hi>Helicon</hi> did hang over, as indeed they do there. Near this Harbour the Convent hath a <hi>Metochy,</hi> or Farm; and in the Harbour they fiſh, and lade the Corn they can ſpare, to tranſport it to the Neighbouring Parts. Thence we turned to the left hand, upon a Ridge of craggy Rocks, about half a Mile, which brought us to the Cell of the Hermite.</p>
            <p>The Hermitage is ſituated upon the South-Eaſt-ſide of a Rock; and is a little Houſe, with a pretty Chapel, or Oratory, at the upper end of a large Garden, moſt pleaſant by Nature, without much Aſſiſtance either of Coſt, or Art. It is only hedged about with ſuch Shrubs, and Buſhes, as the Soil beareth, the upper ſide which is fenced by the Rock, only excepted. But Nature is here profuſe in curious Plants; of which I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered about half a hundred, that grow not ordinarily in <hi>England,</hi> in and about the Garden: Of which I ſhall defer to ſpeak, till I come to <hi>Athens;</hi> becauſe I ſaw moſt of them there again, with many others. Something below his Houſe, deſcending towards the lower ſide of his Garden, is a Fountain of very good Water; and beyond that a River, that runneth down from the high Cliffs of the <hi>Helicon,</hi> making a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Caſcade,</hi> at ſuch a convenient diſtance, that it affordeth great Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to the Eyes, without the leaſt Offence to the Ears: until, at laſt, with all the murmurs of Applauſe, a Poet in his moſt charming Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations can fanſie, it paſſeth by this happy Place, where Peace and Innocency ſeem to dwell; far out of the reach of the Hate or Flattery of inconſtant Fortune; to which, even thoſe Rocks, and the vaſt Stones that lie in its Channel, ſeem to comply, and, while Men ſeem dumb, make their Praiſes mount aloud to Heaven. A prodigious height round about, one diſcovereth the <hi>Helicon's</hi> white Tops, ſtill covered with Snow; which this poor Hermites aged Head ſeemeth, in epitome, to reſemble. He followeth the Steps of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> in the Wilderneſs; not cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Hypocritical Rags; but with a decent long Garment, of a brown Hair-colour, dyed of that hue with the Skins of Wallnuts; and not much differing from the reſt of the <hi>Caloyers.</hi> But his Life is moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere.

The time that he ſpendeth from his Devotions, he employeth in writing Books of their Liturgies. He hath a Companion, or Servant, that doth him all neceſſary Offices; but uſeth not ſuch ſeverity as himſelf. His employment, at ſpare time, is chiefly in making Croſſes; which he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth with admirable Curioſity. The Work is hollow, and ſo fine, that it is beyond Belief; and hath repreſented upon it the principal Parts of our Faith, as the Nativity, Annunciation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but eſpecially the Death and Paſſion of our Saviour. For one of theſe I offered <hi>Ten Dollers;</hi> but he would not part with it, hearing we made no uſe of them in our Devotions in <hi>England.</hi> Upon the Door of his little Chapel, I found a Fragment of an Inſcription; of which I could learn no great News: only theſe words,

            <p>After I had diſcourſed ſometime with this good Old Man, whom they eſteem a Saint, I was conducted below his Garden, between it and the River, to another Hutt; where two other <hi>Caloyers</hi> live, and look to a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, well planted with Beans and Peaſe; and another juſt by it, furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with four or five hundred Stocks of Bees. A Place near as pleaſant as the other above; being juſt upon the Banks of the River; which I eſteem to be that, which <hi>Pauſanias</hi> calleth <hi>Heraclitus;</hi> upon ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ſome of the forementioned Ruins are thoſe of <hi>Bulis.</hi> The good <hi>Caloyer</hi> preſently went, and took a Stock of Bees, and brought me a Plate of delicate white Honey-combs, with Bread and Olives, and very good Wine: To which he ſet us down in his Hutt, and made us a Dinner, with far greater ſatisfaction, than the moſt Princely Banquet in <hi>Europe</hi> could afford us. For the Quiet and Innocency of their Life, the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Beauty of the Place, the Rocks, Mountains, Streams, Woods, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Plants, joyn'd with the Harmonious Notes of Nightingales, and other Birds, in whole Quires, celebrating, and as it were, welcoming that forward Spring, to ſpeak the truth, ſo charmed my melancholick Fancy for a time, that I had almoſt made a Reſolution never to part with ſo great a Happineſs, for whatever the reſt of the World could preſent me with. But, in concluſion, it prov'd too hard a Task for me, ſo ſoon to wean my ſelf from the World.</p>
            <p>We left this Convent ſooner than otherwiſe we ſhould have done, by reaſon of our Janizaries, who began to be too bold with the poor Monks; demanding of them whole Sheep, Rice, Wine, and whatever came in their fancy, without either Modeſty or Diſcretion: And they, poor People, entertain all that come with ſuch things as they have, freely. But few, that are civil, will go away, without making them a Requital, by ſome charitable Preſent.</p>
            <p>We took our Leaves of them about Noon, and went part of the ſame way back, that we came, for about an hour, over the Plain of <hi>Amphryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus:</hi> Then, turning Northwards, we paſſed by a Village under the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licon,</hi> on the right hand,<note place="margin">SYRBE.</note> called <hi>Syrbe:</hi> So ſtill keeping the <hi>Helicon</hi> on our right hand, we kept turning under it, till we came again into the way, which brought us North-Eaſt to <hi>Livadia,</hi> an hour before night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Livadia</hi> is an antient City, and continues ſtill its old Name: For the <hi>Greeks</hi> pronounce B,<note place="margin">LIVADIA. LIBADIA.</note>

The Situation is about a pointed Hill; on the top of which is an old Caſtle, on the North-ſide of the high Cliffs of a moderately high Mountain; which I took to be part of the <hi>Helicon,</hi> ſeeing the white Tops of that over it, until I found it ſeparated from it by a Valley at my Return. But now I ſuppoſe it to be <hi>Mons Tilphuſium,</hi> counted <hi>Fifty Stadia</hi> from <hi>Haliartus,</hi> between that and <hi>Alalcomenae,</hi> and between <hi>Alalacomenae</hi> and <hi>Coronaea.</hi> The River <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyna</hi> riſeth here,<note place="margin">HERCYNA</note> and cometh with ſuch a plentiful Source out of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by the Caſtle, that it turneth twenty Mills in the Town, not a Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot off its riſe; and is a large River, ſo ſoon as it comes together from the ſeveral Mills: which makes me I do not call it the <hi>Fountain;</hi> but think, that ſome other Rivers from the <hi>Helicon</hi> do make it riſe here by a Subterraneous Paſſage under the Mountain.

            <p>This Town was celebrated in old times for the Oracle of <hi>Trophonius;</hi> which was in a Cavern, in a Hill. I rather believe it was in that above the Town, than that Monſieur <hi>Spon</hi> mentions, and we ſaw in a Rock, a Mile diſtant North of it, when we parted thence to <hi>Thebes.</hi> But <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanias</hi> indeed is not ſo clear as might be wiſhed, by reaſon of his long Digreſſion. Nevertheleſs one may collect it, being he ſaith, That the <hi>Trophonian</hi> Grove was by the Fountain of this River <hi>Hercyna:</hi> And I obſerv'd, where the Water iſſueth out in greateſt abundance, it was made up with Boards, juſt in the Corner under the Caſtle, without doubt to cover ſome dangerous Cavern. And <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſaith, This Oracle was in the Mountain above the Grove; ſo that it muſt be that above the Town, if that were the Fountain <hi>Hercyna,</hi> of which there is no doubt. By <hi>Pauſanias</hi> his Deſcription, one would believe, that the Hole on the Top of the Hill reached to this at the Bottom. For thoſe that entred it to conſult the Oracle, were to put their Head and Knees in ſuch a certain place and poſture, and were ſuddenly carried down as by a <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex,</hi> or Whirlepool of a moſt ſwift River. This might eaſily be ſo done, by ſtopping the Water at the Bottom, until it roſe very high; and then letting it go of a ſudden: But he that went to ſteal the Treaſure there, had not ſo good a Preparation: for it prov'd a Trap to him, by which he broke himſelf to pieces, and was taken up another way, as <hi>Pauſanias</hi> informs you. All theſe things want good Search, and Examination; and are not eaſily to be found out by Travellers, that ſtay but a little while in a Place; unleſs we ſhould ſuppoſe them to have ſo many of the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Greek</hi> Authors almoſt by heart. There were publick Games inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in honour of this God <hi>Trophonius:</hi> of which notwithſtanding none of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>But therein they are written
ΤΡΕΦΩΝΙΟΙ,
if I have copied it right; of which I am not ſo well aſſured, as to be poſitive. The Game <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boiotia</hi> is here mentioned, which <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſay, was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in the Plain of <hi>Coronaea,</hi> by or in the Temple of <hi>Minerva Itonia;</hi> where all the <hi>Boeotians</hi> aſſembled for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>January</hi> the Twenty fifth we parted from <hi>Livadia</hi> about eleven in the Morning; and about half a Mile out of Town, being come to the top of a little Hill, being a ſmall Ridge of <hi>Laphyſtius,</hi> we had the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of a ſpacious and fertil Plain, encompaſſed with Mountains, but not very high, if compared with thoſe of <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> and <hi>Helicon.</hi> It is ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in length from <hi>Livadia,</hi> South-Eaſt, near twenty Miles; and in breadth is as much, comprehending the Lake and Marſhes; which take up near half of the North-Eaſt ſide of it. This Lake was formerly called <hi>The Lake of Copais;</hi> but now <hi>Livadias Limne,</hi> or <hi>The Lake of Livadia:</hi> and not <hi>Stivo-lago;</hi> meaning, I ſuppoſe, <hi>Thiva Limne,</hi> as our Modern Maps make it. For that is another Lake, that was formerly called <hi>Hylica pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus:</hi> Of all which I ſhall have more to ſay in the Laſt Book.</p>
            <p>We left the Lake <hi>Copais</hi> at a good diſtance, on the left hand, and kept ſtill ſtreight forwards under the Mountains, on the right hand, South-Eaſtwards; which, I ſuppoſe, were the Mountains <hi>Tilphuſium</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſtius.</hi> I obſerv'd ſix good large Streams, croſſing our way, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Northwards towards the Lake; which may be <hi>Ocaled, Tilphuſa, Lophis, Olmens, Coralius,</hi> and <hi>Permeſſus,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Pauſanias</hi> and <hi>Strabo.</hi> There are many little Villages up and down in this Plain; ſome Vineyards, a great deal of Corn-ground and Paſturage; well ſtock'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with Sheep, and other Cattle. But it is very much ſubject to Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, upon great Rains, or melting of the Snow from the Mountains: which is no wonder, having no Paſſage above ground for the Water out of the Lake, but only that into <hi>Hylica palus:</hi> which alſo lieth ſo high, that the greateſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>art of the Plain muſt needs be drowned, before the overflowing Water would find a Paſſage that way; the ordinary Paſſages out of the Lake being under ground.</p>
            <p>About fourteen Miles from <hi>Livadia</hi> we paſt by a Village on our left hand, called <hi>Charamenitis;</hi> and about an hour before night another, which they call <hi>Diminia;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Two Months,</hi> becauſe the Corn there is ſowed, ripe, and reaped within the ſpace of two Months: the Floods of the Lake not permitting them to ſow before <hi>April,</hi> and it being Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt-time with them by the beginning of <hi>June.</hi> By this Town is a Rock; on the Top of which appear the antient Walls of a Town. My Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:95495:133"/>thinketh, it may be <hi>Oncheſtus;</hi> but I think it rather <hi>Coronaea,</hi> for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I have elſewhere given. Here is a Fountain, that riſeth at the Foot of the Rock; which makes the Stream <hi>Coralius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In half an hour thence we came to <hi>Megalo-molci;</hi> where we lodged in an indifferent good <hi>Kan. Molci</hi> ſignifies properly Farms belonging to the <hi>Grand Signior;</hi> where thoſe that inhabit are no other than his Servants, and Workmen. This is a large ſquare Court, compoſed of little Houſes, for thoſe that either labour, till the Ground, or attend the Cattle; where at night they retire to lodge. Theſe ſeem badly to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the <hi>Roman</hi> Colonies, with this great difference, That thoſe had ſtill ſome great Priviledges granted them; but theſe are all Slaves. The next day we parted thence by Sun-riſing, and within half an hour came to the South-Eaſt end of the Plain, bounded by a little Ridge of a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that runneth out from Mount <hi>Phoenix</hi> on the left hand, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the right I believe was <hi>Libethrius.</hi> As ſoon as we got on the Top of this Hill we began to ſee <hi>Thebes,</hi> at the further end of another Plain, Eaſt North-Eaſt of us; and behind us we had the Hill by <hi>Livadia,</hi> Weſt North-Weſt. This Plain is now called <hi>Thivas Cambos;</hi> and in old time; to the ſame effect, the <hi>Theban Plain.</hi> It is bounded with Hills and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and is much leſs than that of <hi>Livadia.</hi> The Northern Bounds of this I take to be the Mountain <hi>Phoenicius,</hi> from <hi>Strabo;</hi> which <hi>Pauſani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> ſeems to call <hi>Sphinx,</hi> or <hi>Sphingius mons.</hi> That on the right hand, or the Southern Bounds of this Plain, I know not how it was antiently cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; but is a Ridge of the Mountain <hi>Libethrius,</hi> which is the ſame of the Mountain <hi>Helicon:</hi> and is the ſame that ſeparates the Plain of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpia,</hi> from the Plain of <hi>Thebes.</hi> I obſerved a Torrent run down from this Mountain in wet Weather, which ſtagnates in the Plain; and makes it very dangerous to be paſſed, for a time, on that Road. About the middle of this Plain I obſerved a Stream, I ſuppoſe was called <hi>Peroe;</hi> and hard by the Town another, which I believe to be that of <hi>Dirce:</hi> Both which, running Northward, to the Lake of <hi>Thebes,</hi> called now <hi>Thivas Limne,</hi> but antiently <hi>Hylica palus,</hi> we croſſed and arrived at <hi>Thebes</hi> by Noon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thebes</hi> is yet called <gap reason="foreign">

               <note place="margin">THEBES.</note> and not <hi>Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> as our Maps have it; which is from the ſame Errour I have often mentioned, hearing the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſay <hi>Stin, Thiva,</hi> and not knowing how to pronounce their <hi>Theta,</hi> or <hi>Th. Thebes</hi> is ſituated in Thirty eight De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, Twenty two Minutes Latitude, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Vernon</hi> obſerved; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two little Streams, one on the Weſt ſide, and the other on the Eaſt ſide. This I gueſs to be <hi>Iſmenus,</hi> and the other <hi>Dirce,</hi> as I ſaid. I know not why my Comrade ſeemeth of the contrary Opinion. For <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> after he had deſcribed the North, and Eaſt Regions, from the Gate <hi>Praetida</hi> to <hi>Chalcis</hi> ward, begins again at the Gate <hi>Neitis;</hi> and after ſome Monuments taken notice of there, paſſeth this River <hi>Dirce,</hi> and ſo goes on to the Temple of the <hi>Cabira</hi> and <hi>Theſpia:</hi> all which is Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the City. He ſaith alſo, <hi>Iſmenius</hi> is out of the Town, on the right hand of the Gate <hi>Homoloides,</hi> and paſſeth by a Hill, called by the ſame Name, <hi>Iſmenius;</hi> which cannot agree with any thing Weſtward, but with that Eaſtward. This Town ſeemeth now in the ſame conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it was in <hi>Pauſanias</hi> his time; that is to ſay, only inhabited in that
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:95495:134"/>Part, which was the Caſtle; and in more antient times called <hi>Cadmea,</hi> from <hi>Cadmus</hi> its Founder, Son of <hi>Agenor:</hi> who after he had a long time, in vain, ſought his Siſter <hi>Europa,</hi> ſtollen away by <hi>Jupiter;</hi> and not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to return to his Father, by command of the Oracle he ſtaid, and built here a ſtrong Caſtle upon a ſmall Hill: which <hi>Amphion</hi> afterwards walled in, as the Poets fanſie, by the ſound of his Harp, making the Stones to come, and lay themſelves in due Order for the Building. The Walls that now are, ſeem very antient, having ſome ſquare Towers, the Stones well hewn, and laid in very exact Order, according to Rules of Art. The Figure of the Caſtle is oval; and all within the Walls cloſe built, better faſhion'd, and higher than is uſual in that Country. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed three Miles about, and to contain three or four thouſand Souls. The <hi>Turks,</hi> who ſeem the leaſt Part of the Town, have two <hi>Moſques,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſeveral Churches. The Cathedral is called <hi>Panagia Chryſophoritza;</hi> which hath nothing of ſpecial Remark about it, only ſome Fragments of antient Inſcriptions among the Stones of the Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſuch as theſe, in ſome other Places about the Town, are all the Remains of Antiquity we ſaw. We found not the Temples, <hi>Gym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſium,</hi> and other ſuch Buildings, mentioned by the Antients to have been there. This was, in antient times, the chief City of <hi>Boeotia;</hi> yet never were they very famous in Hiſtory, either for Wit, Learning, or Valour: only they behav'd themſelves bravely againſt the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> their General, a <hi>Theban</hi> born, and one of the moſt Valiant and Renowned Captains of <hi>Greece:</hi> which made <hi>Juſtin</hi> ſay, <hi>That the Glory of the Thebans was born, and buried with</hi> Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das.</p>
            <p>There are two <hi>Kans</hi> in the Town; but we lodged at a <hi>Greek</hi>'s Houſe, called <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> Son of <hi>Panagioti Luca</hi> of <hi>Livadia;</hi> who entertain'd us civilly. He carried us a little out of the Town, towards the way to <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gropont;</hi> and ſhewed us a Hill, where they dig a kind of Stone they make Bowls for Tabaco-pipes of. The Stone, when 'tis firſt dig'd out of a deep Pit, is of the colour of new Cheeſe, and almoſt as ſoft, being in lumps ordinarily as big as a Man's two Fiſts. This they bring to the Town, and carve very curiouſly into Bowls of Pipes; which, as ſoon as it is dry, groweth very hard, as white as Snow, and ſhining.

            <p>The <hi>Pappa</hi> told us, That thoſe who laid the Saint's Body there, thought good to put another Inſcription upon it, to hide it from the Heathens.

            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday January</hi> the Twenty ſixth, we parted from <hi>Thiva,</hi> or <hi>Thebes,</hi> as ſoon as it was day; and going out at the Eaſt-gate, we turned South-Eaſtwards, and paſſed a long the Stream <hi>Iſmenus,</hi> which turneth ſeveral Mills in its courſe. After a Mile, or a Mile and half riding up Hill, by an eaſie Aſcent, we came to the Fountain-head; which is a very fine, large, and clear Spring, and was dedicated to <hi>Mars,</hi> who, as the Poets tell, protected it by a Dragon. We ſtill kept on, mounting by an eaſie Aſcent, a Mile or two further; and then again as eaſily deſcending a little way, by a Bridge we paſt over a Stream, which runneth Eaſtwards; and is, without doubt, the River <hi>Aſopus.</hi> After this we began again to aſcend; and at laſt went up a Rocky Hill, by a very bad way, until about Noon we got paſt the Top of it, to a Village called <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lachi;</hi>
               <note place="margin">ULACHI.</note> which is the Name the <hi>Albaneſes</hi> call themſelves by, in their own Language; and is inhabited by them, in about thirty or forty Houſes. I obſerved ſome antient Walls, and Caves under ground; and before we came to it, a little Tower, upon the Top of a Hill, from whence one ſeeth <hi>Thebes,</hi> as I was after told by <hi>Conſul Giraud.</hi> This is a kind of Ridge of the Mountain <hi>Cithaeron,</hi> that runneth out from it Eaſtward towards <hi>Oropus,</hi> and was ſometimes the Bounds of <hi>Attica</hi> and <hi>Boeotia:</hi> And this Village was, in old times, perhaps, that <hi>Harma</hi> of <hi>Attica,</hi>
               <note place="margin">HARMA ATTICAE.</note> mention'd by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients.
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:95495:135"/>This Village had been pillaged by Pyrates, not above two or three days before; and they were almoſt frighted out of their Senſes, at the ſight of us. It is ſtrange thoſe Robbers ſhould be ſo bold, as to come ſo far from Sea, and up ſo bad ways, as they muſt needs do to come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For from the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Gulph, it is at leaſt fifteen Miles; and as much, or more, from that of <hi>Negropont.</hi> And that they ſhould not be able to defend themſelves from ſo inconſiderable a number of Men, as thoſe Pyrates muſt needs be, is as ſtrange. But the reaſon is, That in the day-time few of the Men, pertaining to that Place, are at home, being diſperſed up and down the Mountains with their Flocks and Herds; and are not permitted by the <hi>Turks,</hi> to have Arms in their Houſes.</p>
            <p>After Dinner we paſſed over a Plain, for two hours and a half; and by the way, I obſerved many Ponds up and down in it, with plenty of Wild Ducks, and Teal in them; one or two of which we ſhot. Here are alſo many of thoſe Oaks I before deſcribed at <hi>Troy,</hi> with great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns they gather <hi>Vellania</hi> from. Thence we mounted again, until to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Evening, we came to the Top of the Mountain <hi>Parnes,</hi> or <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes;</hi> which muſt not be miſtaken for <hi>Parnaſſus.</hi> This is a great and high Mountain, and was the more antient Bounds of the <hi>Attica,</hi> before <hi>Citheron</hi> came to be ſo. My Companion calleth it now <hi>Ozea,</hi> or <hi>Noezaea:</hi> and 'tis very true, that part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> going from <hi>Attica</hi> to <hi>Negropont,</hi> is called ſo: but this is called <hi>Chaſha,</hi> from a Village on the ſide of it, in the way down to the Plains of <hi>Attica,</hi> ſo named. Here we lay in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ruin'd <hi>Kan,</hi> without any Door, or any other Accommodation belonging to it, but what we brought with us; only there is a very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Fountain hard by it, where the Wolves, and Bears, and Wild Boars come to drink; to which this Mountain is yet a great Covert. For it is indeed almoſt covered with Pine-trees; of which we made a good Fire to keep us from the cold; and ſtopped up the Entrance into the <hi>Kan,</hi> to ſecure us from the Aſſaults of Wild Beaſts.</p>
            <p>Juſt by this Place,<note place="margin">BIGLA-CA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STRO.</note> upon a Rock in the Paſſage, are the Ruins of an old Caſtle, which they now call <hi>Bigla-Caſtro,</hi> which ſignifies a Watch-Tower. The Walls that remain ſeem very antient, and are well cemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together, of good, well hewn, and hard Stone. The Diſtance from <hi>Athens</hi> that Authors give of <hi>Phyla,</hi> and the Deſcription of <hi>Xenophon,</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> make me believe, that this was antiently called <hi>Phyla,</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for the Exploit of <hi>Thraſibulus;</hi> who here began his Stratagem, for regaining the Liberty of his Country, <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Attica,</hi> from the thirty Tyrants impoſed on them by the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> From this Mountain we looked down, with unſpeakable Pleaſure and Content, upon the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated <hi>Athens,</hi> we had ſo long wiſhed to be at; with the noble Plains of <hi>Attica,</hi> ſo famous in antient Story. The next Morning we deſcended the Mountain by a narrow and dangerous way, paſſing by a Village called <hi>Chaſha,</hi> about half way down. From the Foot of this Mountain to <hi>Athens,</hi> is a very good plain way, and of about ten or a dozen Miles thither, as I believe; for we came not to <hi>Athens,</hi> till near about Noon: firſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by a Wood of Olive-trees, about three Miles diſtant from the Town, with ſeveral pleaſant Villages of the <hi>Athenians</hi> in it, and a River run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through it. This was on <hi>Friday January</hi> the Twenty-ſeventh,</p>
            <pb n="335" facs="tcp:95495:135"/>
            <p>We began now to think our ſelves come into a more civillized Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, than we had yet paſſed. For not a Shepherd that we met, but bid us welcom, and wiſhed us a good Journey. We went, and alighted at M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Jean Giraud</hi>'s Houſe, Conſul for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Athens;</hi> who with great Humanity received and entertain'd us, during our Stay there, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us all the Friendly Offices we could wiſh; and whom, in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, we found to be a worthy, honeſt, and ingenious Man, very fit for that Place; underſtanding the Modern Languages very well. Now therefore we reſolved to reſt us ſome time, and to refreſh our ſelves, after our tedious and weariſom Journey from <hi>Zant.</hi> And this we had need enough to do, that we might with the more Care and Exactneſs, ſee, view, and compare all things neceſſary to give an Account of this Place, that might not deſerve ſo much Cenſure for the Truth of it, as ſome before us have done.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>ATHENS</hi> is the chief City of that Province of <hi>Greece,</hi> which was called, in times paſt, <hi>Attica;</hi> a City now reduced to near the loweſt Ebb of Fortune: But of Fame ſo great, that few Cities in the World can diſpute Precedence with her, or few pretend to have been her Equals. For, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you conſider her Antiquity, Valour, Power, Learning, or any other Quality, that may make a Place illuſtrious, and renowned in the World, ſhe ſtill ſeems triumphant. Neither hath any City had a larger ſhare in good and bad Fortune, than <hi>Athens.</hi> Her People owned no Original, but the Earth they inhabited; and ſcarce allowed the Sun to be elder than they: Nor would they acknowledge to have received their Name from any, but their chief Goddeſs <hi>Minerva,</hi> whom they knew by the Name of
ΑΘΗΝΑ.
But they planted many Colonies, and gave both Names and Laws to them; of which <hi>Meurſius</hi> reckons to the number of forty.</p>
            <p>But the leſs credulous among them, and more judicious Hiſtorians, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, That <hi>Cecrops,</hi> being the firſt that reduced the Inhabitants of <hi>Attica,</hi> the Off-ſpring of the <hi>Carians</hi> and <hi>Aonians,</hi> under a Political Government, did by the ſame means advance himſelf to be their King; and as the moſt advantageous Place of his whole Dominions, which contain'd all within the Mountains <hi>Gerania, Oenoa, Parnes,</hi> and <hi>Lycabettus;</hi> that is, from the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> to <hi>Oropus,</hi> near the Mouth of the River <hi>Aſopus,</hi> choſe this Rock, which is ſituated in a large Plain, and near the middle of this Country, to build the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of his Kingdom, calling it, and its whole Territory by his own Name, <hi>Cecropia;</hi> whereas it was called before him, <hi>Actica;</hi> and alſo <hi>Ionia,</hi> from <hi>Ion,</hi> the Son of <hi>Xuthus.</hi>

            <p>This, they ſuppoſe, came to paſs not long after <hi>Deucalion</hi>'s Flood, Eight hundred and thirty Years before the Building of <hi>Rome,</hi> and about a Thouſand, five hundred, and eighty Years before the Incarnation of our Saviour; to which the time that is ſince elapſed, being added, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:95495:137"/>a Thouſand, ſix hundred, ſeventy eight Years, it will be about Three thouſand, two hundred, and fifty Years ago, that <hi>Athens</hi> was built; not to be more exact, than I can juſtify. For even the Chronologers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves differ in their Accounts ſome Years.

            <p>
               <hi>Cecrops</hi> divided his Kingdom into twelve principal Cities, and was the Author of many excellent Laws and Conſtitutions, eſpecially touching Marriage. Wherefore they repreſented him like <hi>Janus,</hi> with two Faces, but one Head; ſignifying, that the Union between Man and Wife, was ſuch, that they made but <hi>One Being,</hi> with different Aſpects. Each of theſe twelve Cities had Courts of Judicature, and Magiſtrates of their own: and were ſo little ſubject to their Princes, the Succeſſors and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of <hi>Cecrops,</hi> that they ſeldom or never conſulted them, ſave only in caſes of ſome imminent and publick Danger; and did ſo abſolutely order their own Concerns, that ſometimes they waged War againſt each other, without their Kings. But ſtill <hi>Cecropia</hi> was the chief Seat of their Empire, and daily augmented in Riches, Greatneſs, and Strength, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til <hi>Ericthonius,</hi> the fourth King of <hi>Attica;</hi> who being admoniſhed by the Oracle, That <hi>Neptune</hi> and <hi>Minerva</hi> did ſtrive who ſhould have the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of giving a new Name to his City, put it to the general Vote of his People; wherein both Sexes, Men and Women, having their Voices, the Goddeſs <hi>Minerva</hi> carried it, and had the Victory by one Vote. So they named the City after her own Name, <hi>Athena:</hi> For ſo is <hi>Minerva</hi> called by the <hi>Greeks.</hi> In memory hereof the <hi>Attick</hi> Games alſo, called <hi>Panathenaea,</hi> came to be publickly celebrated: And from that time the City was called <hi>Athenae,</hi> or <hi>Athens.</hi> This is to be ſeen in abundance of the moſt antient Coyns, and Monuments of this Place, as well as Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Upon the one ſide of their Coyns, is the Head of <hi>Minerva,</hi> ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with her Helmet on, within a Wreath of Olive-branches; and on the other ſide an <hi>Owl,</hi> her beloved Bird, in thoſe times reckoned the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of Wiſdom; with theſe Letters about it, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>Thus <hi>Athens,</hi> and the Country of <hi>Attica</hi> continued united, until <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion,</hi> the Second of that Name, and the Eighth <hi>Athenian</hi> King; who dying, by his Laſt Will and Teſtament, divided his Kingdom into four Parts, and left it amongſt his four Sons, <hi>Aegens, Lycus, Pallas,</hi> and <hi>Niſus.</hi> To his eldeſt Son, <hi>Aegeus,</hi> he left the Plain, and City of <hi>Athens,</hi> together with the Plaint of <hi>Eleuſis</hi> and <hi>Thriaſius;</hi> bounded from <hi>Megaris</hi> by the Mountains <hi>Cerato;</hi> from the <hi>Eleutherians,</hi> by the Mountains <hi>Oenoa</hi> and <hi>Paecilus;</hi> and from the <hi>Athenian</hi> Plain, by the Mountain <hi>Coridales;</hi> which alſo hath Mount <hi>Parnes</hi> North, the Mountains <hi>Brileſſus</hi> and <hi>Pentelicus</hi> North-Eaſt; not <hi>Ancheſmus,</hi> as Monſieur <hi>De la Gulitier</hi> calls it.

               <pb n="341" facs="tcp:95495:138"/>which contain'd that part of the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> towards <hi>Corinth,</hi> the Mountain <hi>Gerania,</hi> and the Plain of <hi>Megara,</hi> to the Mountain <hi>Cerata.</hi> But <hi>Aegeus,</hi> caſting himſelf down from the <hi>Acropolis,</hi> by his untimely Death made way to his Son <hi>Theſeus</hi> his more early Succeſſion to the Crown, than otherwiſe by nature could have been expected. <hi>Theſeus</hi> proved afterwards a Man of ſo great Wiſdom, Strength, and Courage, that he was accounted another <hi>Hercules,</hi> whom he took pleaſure to imitate. He likewiſe reduced all thoſe Provinces, which his Father had ſeparated, and united them again to his Kingdom of <hi>Attica,</hi> making <hi>Athens</hi> his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital City, and the Seat of the Law, and ordaining all the reſt of his People, to appeal thither, if need were, for Juſtice. So having depriv'd all the other Cities of their particular (independent) Senates and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, he reduc'd them all to one great Councel, or Senate, at <hi>Athens,</hi> called the <hi>Prytaneum.</hi> For which, and many other publick Benefits, and Heroick Actions, he was after his Death thought worthy to be honour'd with Divine Worſhip, and to have place amongſt their Tutelar Gods. For which reaſon alſo, upon the Gate of <hi>Adrian</hi>'s Palace, on that ſide towards the City, there is an Inſcription, ſignifying thus much, <hi>This is</hi> Athens, <hi>in times paſt the City of</hi> Theſeus; and on that ſide, which the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> had built, is engraven, <hi>This is the City of</hi> Adrian, <hi>and not of</hi> Theſeus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Athens</hi> continued a <hi>Monarchy</hi> about Five hundred and fifty Years, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Death of <hi>Codrus</hi> the ſeventeenth, and laſt King; a Prince leſs fortunate, than brave.

                  <hi>Herodot.</hi> l. 5.</note> Tribes. After this they had War with the <hi>Perſians;</hi> and with wonderful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, routed the numerous Armies of <hi>Darius,</hi> and <hi>Xerxes;</hi> and that with inconſiderable numbers. in proportion to their Enemies: which they perform'd under the diſcreet and happy Conduct of thoſe valiant Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, <hi>Miltiades</hi> and <hi>Themiſtocles;</hi> at Land, in their wonderful Victory
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:95495:139"/>of <hi>Marathon,</hi> obtain'd againſt a Million of Men; of which, 'tis ſaid, not Fifty thouſand eſcaped; and by Sea, in the Fight at <hi>Salamis,</hi> againſt <hi>Xerxes</hi> his Navy.<note place="margin">Herodot.</note> But in their Wars with the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> they were not ſo Fortunate: For theſe took <hi>Athens,</hi> and impoſed over them for Governours thirty Tyrants. But from this diſgraceful condition they were ſoon delivered by the Policy and Valour of <hi>Thraſibulus;</hi> and, at laſt, by the Help of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> under that brave General <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> at the Battle of <hi>Leuctra,</hi> they ſo perfectly ſubdued the <hi>Spartans</hi> their Enemies, that they could never recover themſelves again. Inſomuch that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> became Maſters of the <hi>Aegean</hi> Seas, and of the greateſt part of the Iſles therein, going on Conquerours even to the Borders of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and had, as <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> reports, a thouſand Cities under them. They held the Sovereignty of <hi>Greece</hi> for Threeſcore and ten Years; but kept it no longer, by reaſon of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and <hi>Thebans,</hi> emulating their Greatneſs, and ſtirring up Factions and Diviſions in <hi>Greece</hi> againſt them. At which time nevertheleſs, the <hi>Eleutherians</hi> voluntarily joyned themſelves to them,<note place="margin">Panſan.</note> partly out of ſpite to the <hi>Thebans,</hi> and partly out of a great liking they had taken to the <hi>Athenian</hi> way of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But at length, all ſides being grown weary of fighting, and a general Peace concluded, the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſoon began to ſlight the Vertue of their Anceſtors, and to give themſelves over to Luxury and Idleneſs, loving their Eaſe ſo much, that they made it Treaſon for any to propoſe the Re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of their Army, or the raiſing any Money for the maintenance of it; preferring a lucky Satyriſt, before the braveſt Captain; and to hear a Play, before the gaining of the greateſt Conqueſt: Which degenerous Diſpoſition of theirs, in a ſhort time, gave opportunity and leiſure to the <hi>Macedonians</hi> to advance their Monarchy, and extend it by little and little over all <hi>Greece;</hi> a Deſign projected by <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but atchieved and perfected by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, his Son. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> brake their Power at Sea, and took from them the <hi>Aegean</hi> Iſlands; and they tamely permitted his Son, <hi>Alexander,</hi> to deprive them of what remained by Land, to ſuch a degree of Subjection, as to diſarm them of their very Tongues, by reſtraining them from talking in their Publick Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; by ſo much, no doubt, more grievous to them, by how much they naturally loved, and uſed the Liberty of that Member. For who ſuch Wits in all <hi>Greece,</hi> as the <hi>Athenians?</hi> who ſuch Talkers? who ſo Pragmatical, and buſie in all Affairs? And, to give many of them their due, none ſo Eloquent and Learned. After the Death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> they endeavour'd to recover their Liberty, but without any great Succeſs. Under the Protection of the <hi>Romans,</hi> they enjoyed it in ſome compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent meaſure; until ſiding with <hi>Mithridates.</hi> King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful Wars, they again loſt it, and quite ruined themſelves. For <hi>Sylla</hi> being inform'd, That they voluntarily took <hi>Mithridates</hi> his part, in his Rage, put the greateſt part of the Inhabitants to the Sword; and had deſtroyed all, had not the Night favour'd the Eſcape of ſome. He ſet fire on <hi>Piraeum</hi> and <hi>Munichia,</hi> and ſpared neither ſacred nor profane Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in his Fury. After this they were unfortunate alſo in taking the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſide, in the Wars between <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey.</hi> But <hi>Caeſar</hi> was no leſs a merciful, than a fortunate and valiant Conquerour; he pardoned
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:95495:139"/>the Living for the ſakes of the Dead. But after his Death they ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves moſt ungrateful to his Memory, in erecting Statues to his Murderer <hi>Brutus.</hi> But this coſt them the Iſle of <hi>Aegina,</hi> ſo ſoon as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> came to ſucceed in the Empire. In the Reign of <hi>Tiberius, Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,</hi> his adopted Son, paſſing by <hi>Athens,</hi> treated them as <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Allies</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and honour'd them with the Priviledge of having a Lictor; which is a mark of Sovereign Power. <hi>Caligula,</hi> his Son, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Throne, took away their Image of <hi>Jupiter Olympius,</hi> and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it to be brought to <hi>Rome;</hi> where he brake off the Head of the God, and ſet his own upon the Trunk.</p>
            <p>In the time of <hi>Claudius,</hi> Succeſſour to <hi>Caligula,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> came to <hi>Athens;</hi> and having in his way from the Port to the City, obſerv'd an Altar, as the Inſcription ſhewed, <hi>dedicated to the unknown God,</hi> he took occaſion to preach unto them God, <hi>the Creator of all things;</hi> whom, till then, they had worſhipped in Ignorance. To whoſe Preaching the great <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius,</hi> a Senator of the chief Court <hi>Areopagus,</hi> joyn'd himſelf, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the <hi>Firſt-Fruits of the Faith</hi> in that City. And therefore deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly appointed by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> to be their Firſt Biſhop; having now added Divinity to his Philoſophy. And this was conformable to the Apoſtles Practice, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Clement</hi> informs us, in his Firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> And this was the firſt Foundation of the Church of Chriſt in <hi>Athens.</hi> For <hi>Athens</hi> till then was the Seminary of ſuperſtitious Temples, and falſe Worſhip; of which <hi>Pauſanias</hi> gives an ample Deſcription; and <hi>Pliny</hi> in his time aſſures us, There were no leſs than three Images worſhipped there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nero,</hi> to ſhew his Ingenuity amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> made a Voyage into <hi>Achaia,</hi> and, without doubt, ſpent no ſmall time at <hi>Athens.</hi> My Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade is of opinion, That a ſingular Medal he hath ſeen, where the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſtile <hi>Nero, The Saviour of Mankind,</hi> was coined at <hi>Athens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> reduc'd <hi>Achaia</hi> to be a Province of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging them to be Subject to the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, and to be governed by a <hi>Proconſul;</hi> to one of whom, named <hi>Rufus Feſtus,</hi> an Inſcription up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a great Stone near the Temple of <hi>Minerva</hi> is dedicated. Yet under the Emperour <hi>Trajan,</hi> this Province of <hi>Achaia,</hi> as well as other Places of <hi>Greece,</hi> enjoyed at leaſt ſome ſhew of Liberty; as appears by a Letter, which <hi>Pliny</hi> wrote to one <hi>Maximus,</hi> who was ſent thither by the Senate to be their Governour. The Tenor of which Epiſtle, is as followeth: <q>
                  <hi>Remember,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that you are going into</hi> Achaia, <hi>the proper and true</hi> Greece; <hi>That you are appointed to govern a State of free Cities, who have maintained their Liberty by their Valour. Take not away any thing of their Priviledges, their Dignity, no nor yet of their Preſumption. But conſider, it is a Country, that hath of long time given Laws, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved none. That it is to</hi> Athens <hi>thou goeſt; where it would be thought a barbarous Cruelty in thee, to deprive them of that ſhadow, and name of Liberty, which as yet remaineth to them.</hi>
               </q> But ſo it was, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe, and ſome other like Indulgences, which they had from ſeveral Emperours, they could never perfectly recover themſelves from the ſad Effects of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Cruelty, until the time of <hi>Hadrian,</hi> who being advanc'd to the Imperial Dignity, with great Munificence reſtor'd this City to its former Beauty: The reaſon whereof was, That in his younger Years he
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:95495:140"/>had been choſen <hi>Archon;</hi> that is, the chief Magiſtrate there; and had taken ſuch a particular Affection to the Place, that being now made Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and viſiting the Provinces, he ſtaid a conſiderable time at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> and gave them many Priviledges; as their publick Games, which in honour of him were call'd <hi>Adrianalia,</hi> and a thouſand Wild Beaſts eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year to hunt in the <hi>Stadium,</hi> building himſelf a Palace there, with a publick Library and Schools, for teaching the Liberal Arts and Sciences; conſecrating a Temple to <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Juno, Panellenians;</hi> and alſo build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another of vaſt Magnificence, to <hi>Jupiter Olympius:</hi> In fine, This Emperour not only rebuilt or repaired thoſe publick Buildings, that Time, and the Wars had either defac'd or ruin'd; but added alſo, at his own charge, one whole Region of Buildings to the City, ſo large and beautiful, that it deſerved to be call'd afterwards <hi>New Athens,</hi> as it is on his Aqueduct.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> finiſhed this famous Aqueduct of white Marble, which this Emperour, <hi>Hadrian,</hi> had begun. <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> augmented the number of publick Profeſſors in the Schools, and would be ſolemnly ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated among them. Only the Emperour <hi>Septimius Severus</hi> thought not fit to continue the Kindneſs of his Predeceſſors to them; but bare them a Grudge even to his dying day; for no greater Reaſon, as 'tis thought, than ſome little Affront he received from them in his Youth, when he was there either out of Curioſity to ſee the Place, or at his Study. But whatever it was, it coſt them a great part of their Priviledges.</p>
            <p>The Emperour <hi>Valerian,</hi> who reigned long after <hi>Severus,</hi> permitted them to rebuild their Walls: which yet could not hinder the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> from making themſelves once Maſters of the City. But it was but for a ſhort time: For the brave <hi>Cleodemus,</hi> rallying the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd Forces, raiſing a new Army, and getting together ſome Ships, ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſoon put to flight the Army of thoſe Barbarians.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the Chriſtian Emperours, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Firſt was their great Friend and Benefactour, honouring their Governours with the Title of <hi>Arch-Duke.</hi> From the Bounty of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Second, they obtain'd ſeveral Iſles of the <hi>Archipelago.</hi> Under the Reign of <hi>Arcadius,</hi> they paſſed the common Fate of the reſt of <hi>Greece;</hi> as likewiſe of all <hi>Italy,</hi> being ſack'd and pillag'd by <hi>Alarick,</hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> as <hi>Syneſius</hi> ſaith; who lived in the ſame Age, and compares <hi>Athens</hi> at that time to an Animal, whoſe Entrails are conſum'd with Rottenneſs. Yet <hi>Zozimus</hi> ſays, That <hi>Alarick</hi> ſpared <hi>Athens,</hi> as fanſying that he ſaw <hi>Achilles,</hi> that famous <hi>Hero,</hi> and Captain General of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> fighting for them upon the Walls. <hi>Juſtinian</hi> was a good Friend to them. But in the following Ages, until the Thirteenth Century, there is deep ſilence of them, either for want of Hiſtorians, who, in thoſe Times, were few and obſcure; or that it pleaſed Divine Providence, to give them ſuch a long term of Privacy and Peace, as that little notice was taken of their Affairs, in relation to the reſt of the World. In the Thirteenth Century, I know not upon what Offence, <hi>Theodorus Laſcaris,</hi> the then <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour, beſieged it; but was repulſed. After him, one ſtiled <hi>The Marqueſs Bonifacius</hi> took it: But how long he held it, or who took it from him, appears not. It was afterwards governed by one <hi>Delves,</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon.</hi> But he dying, the <hi>Turks,</hi> under the Command and Conduct of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet,</hi>
               <pb n="345" facs="tcp:95495:140"/>their Emperour, took it with <hi>Boeotia;</hi> and were within a while diſpoſſeſſed of it again, by that valiant Chriſtian Souldier, <hi>Reinerius Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciaiolo,</hi> a <hi>Florentine;</hi> who reduced it under the State of <hi>Venice.</hi> But they, not having had it long, it was, upon ſome Differences happening, retaken from them by <hi>Anthony,</hi> a natural Son of <hi>Reinerius.</hi> The Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Acciaioli</hi> were Maſters of <hi>Attica</hi> and <hi>Boeotia,</hi> a conſiderable ſpace of time. For <hi>Nerius,</hi> a Couſin of <hi>Anthony,</hi> ſucceeded him; and after <hi>Nerius,</hi> another <hi>Anthony,</hi> Brother to <hi>Nerius;</hi> and after him <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus:</hi> From whom it fell under the Dominion of the <hi>Turks,</hi> in the time of <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Second, in the Year 1455. for want of Succour; which the <hi>Greeks</hi> in vain deſired of the <hi>Latines;</hi> who would do nothing for them upon other terms, than their Conformity in Religion, and renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing thoſe Points, wherein they differ'd from them: little conſidering, that the <hi>Turks</hi> made <hi>Greece</hi> but a ſtep, to bring them ſo much nearer to <hi>Italy;</hi> and that they were ſworn Enemies to Chriſtianity in general, and not to the <hi>Greeks</hi> only. They have been ever ſince under the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Tyranny; and are like ſo to continue, until God ſhall reſtore them to Liberty: which is far beyond the reach of Human Policy to conceive how, or by what means it ſhould be; ſo long as Chriſtendom is ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united in it ſelf, and that Divine Providence, for our Sins, permitteth the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Arms and Superſtition ſo mightily to prevail. They, poor People, bear their preſent Affliction with as much Quietneſs, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Patience, as they did in times paſt ſhew Courage and Magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in maintaining their Liberty. And this brings me to conſider what the preſent Condition of <hi>Athens</hi> is; having, with all the ſpeed I could, run over the Accounts, which the Antients have given more at large of her various Fortune.</p>
            <p>Although the antient Greatneſs of <hi>Athens</hi> is vaniſhed,<note place="margin">The Name.</note> and remains on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Story in <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> and ſome other antient Writers, Time and Fate having devoured the Subſtance; yet ſhe ſtill retains her antient Name, with little or no Alteration. For they ſtill call the City <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>[Athene,]</hi> which they pronounce <hi>[Athini.]</hi> Therefore I wonder, our Modern <hi>Geographers</hi> have been no better inform'd concerning ſo eminent a Place, calling it moſt corruptly in their Maps, ſometimes <hi>Saithenes,</hi> otherwhile <hi>Setines,</hi> and <hi>Satina,</hi> &amp;c. deceived, as I have before obſerved, by the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Seamen; who, hearing the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſay, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce <hi>Stin Athini,</hi> have form'd thoſe barbarous Names out of their own Brains.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Athini,</hi> or <hi>Athens,</hi> is ſituated in almoſt the middle of a large Plain;<note place="margin">Situation.</note> which, ſo much as it wants in Fruitfulneſs, is recompenſed with Health and Beauty. It hath the Mountain <hi>Parnes</hi> North, called now <hi>Chaſha</hi> and <hi>Nozea; Pentelcus,</hi> or <hi>Pendely,</hi> North-Eaſt, about ſix Miles diſtant; <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mettus,</hi> or <hi>Telo-bouni,</hi> from Eaſt to South, about five Miles from it; Port <hi>Phalera,</hi> Weſt South-Weſt, four Miles; and <hi>Porto-Leone,</hi> or <hi>Pyraeas,</hi> Weſt by South, five Miles: the Hills <hi>Coridalia,</hi> now <hi>Daphni Bouni,</hi> from Weſt to almoſt North, at ſix or ſeven Miles diſtance. Nearer to the Town it hath a little pointed Rock, called from a Chapel there is on the top, <hi>[Tou Hagiou Georgiou vouni,]</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Georges Mountain:</hi> which might, in times paſt, be that which <hi>Pauſanias</hi> calleth <hi>Ancheſmus,</hi> a little Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:95495:141"/>Not, as the <hi>French</hi> Author of the <hi>New and Old Athens</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telicus,</hi> covered with Woods, and where the Quarries of Marble are: For here, upon this Mountain of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>George,</hi> are neither Woods, nor Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; being only a bare Rock, lying about a Mile off the Town, Eaſt North-Eaſt. It hath the Chanel of the River <hi>Iliſſus</hi> running by it, South-Eaſt, and turneth round it South, and South-Weſtwards, by the Hill called, in times paſt, the <hi>Muſaeum;</hi> and is about a Bow-ſhot, South-Weſt, of the <hi>Acropolis,</hi> or Caſtle. Whence it falls into another Stream; which, riſing by ſeveral Fountains from Mount <hi>Parnes</hi> and <hi>Pentelicus,</hi> runneth by the City, North-Eaſt, about three Miles diſtant from it; and wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, in its paſſage, a Wood of Olive trees, of at leaſt half a dozen Miles long, and one or two broad: which is now the greateſt Wealth and Ornament of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Plain. It is not eaſie to determin, whether this River ſhould be called <hi>Cephiſus,</hi> or <hi>Eridanus. Strabo</hi> plainly calleth it <hi>Cephiſus:</hi> But our Geographers, of late and modern Times, make it <hi>Eridanus;</hi> with whom I will not, for the preſent, diſpute. Only, I muſt tell them,<note place="margin">Latitude.</note> They are out in their Latitude of <hi>Athens,</hi> whatever they are in their Longitude. For they place it in <hi>Thirty Seven</hi> Degrees Latitude, and <hi>Fifty Three</hi> Longitude: whereas M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Vernon</hi> found it to be <hi>Thirty Eight</hi> Degrees, <hi>Five</hi> Minutes Latitude.</p>
            <p>The Cittadel that now is, was at firſt all the City, having no other Inhabitants, but ſuch as dwelt within thoſe Walls: Afterwards, in times of its greateſt Proſperity, it was no more than the Caſtle, or <hi>Acropolis,</hi> ſtanding in the middle of the City. And ſtill it continueth to be the Caſtle, even in this low Eſtate; though it cannot, at preſent, be ſaid to ſtand in the middle of it; but rather ſomewhat above it to the South-Weſt: the reſt encompaſſing, in antient times, being quite deſtroyed. So that the preſent Town lieth not round about the Caſtle, as antiently, but to the North-Weſt ſide of it; being now ſpread on the Plain under it in length, I believe, a Mile and half, in breadth ſomewhat above a Mile; and is eſteem'd four Miles in Circumference. It hath no Walls to defend it ſelf; inſomuch that they have been frequently ſurpriz'd by the Pirates from Sea, and ſuſtained great Loſſes from them: Until ſome Years ſince, they ſecured all the Avenues into the Town by Gates, which they built anew, and made the utmoſt Houſes, lying cloſe together, to ſerve inſtead of Walls. Theſe they now ſhut up every night; and are by them reaſonably well ſecured from thoſe <hi>Corſairs.</hi> The Houſes are very cloſe built together, and the Streets very narrow. The whole is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into Eight Quarters, or Pariſhes; which they call <hi>Platoma;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Caſtle. Their Names, and Situation, are theſe which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Firſt is called <hi>Placa,</hi> and is ſituate on the South-Eaſt-ſide of the Town. It hath in it the Monument called <hi>The Lanthorn of Demoſthenes,</hi> the Church entituled <hi>Hagio-Kyra,</hi> and the Conſul's Houſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Second is called <hi>Sotiras Tou Kotaki;</hi> and lieth Eaſtwards, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Church <hi>Lycodemou.</hi>

            <p>To theſe the Caſtle being added, <hi>Athens</hi> is not ſo deſpicable a Place, that it ſhould deſerve to be conſider'd only as a ſmall Village, according to the Report of ſome Travellers; who, perhaps, have ſeen it only from Sea, through the wrong end of their Perſpective-Glaſ. For from the Sea the Caſtle is only perceivable; which hideth all the reſt of the Town, ſpread out upon the Plain, North of it. But if it be compared with the former State, when it took up a conſiderable Part of the Plain, was joyned to its two Ports, <hi>Phaleracus</hi> and <hi>Pyraeus,</hi> by its two long Walls; one four Miles in length, the other five, <hi>Munichia</hi> being joyn'd to <hi>Pyraea</hi> between them; when it gave Laws to other Nations, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived none; when it was the Seat of the Muſes, of Wit, Eloquence, and Learning; where all Arts and Sciences ſeem'd to be born, nurſed up, and brought to their full State, and heighth of Perfection: Indeed thoſe that ſhall thus conſider <hi>Athens,</hi> will find the Scene quite changed; Philoſophers being now more rigorouſly baniſhed thence by Fate, than they could ever be in old time by the ill Humours of their Governours. For the <hi>Athenians</hi> have had their ſhare in the ill Fortune of all thoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cities of the Eaſt; the Fury of the Deſtroyer having caſt them alſo down, although not utterly extinguiſh'd them. Indeed I have ſeen but few Towns in <hi>Turky,</hi> that have preſerv'd themſelves ſo well as this, nor that enjoy greater Priviledges under the Tyranny of the <hi>Turks.</hi> True it is, ſome other Cities, by Trading, ſeem more Rich than <hi>Athens.</hi> But I attribute this rather to the bad Fortune of the Place, than to want either of good Harbours, or good Merchandize, to export, or vend for ſuch as may be imported.</p>
            <p>They count their Town, as I ſaid, four Miles in compaſs,<note place="margin">The <hi>Athenians</hi> Quality and Numbers.</note> and eſteem themſelves Eight, or Ten thouſand Inhabitants, whereof three Parts are Chriſtians, the reſt <hi>Turks:</hi> No <hi>Jews</hi> among them; nor would they ever admit any to inhabit with them, although it hath often been attempted. For this muſt, with great truth, be ſaid of them: Their bad Fortune hath not been able to take from them, what they have by Nature; that is, much natural Subtilty, or Wit; of which,<note place="margin">Natural Wit.</note> the Serenity and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Air they enjoy, may be a great natural Cauſe; as I doubt not, but it is of the Healthineſs of the People: which is ſuch,<note place="margin">Health.</note> that it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly obſerv'd, that when the Peſtilence is round about them,<note place="margin">From good Air.</note> at <hi>Thebes, Negropont, Napoly, Corinth,</hi> &amp;c. it ſeldom, or very rarely cometh thither. Their natural Dexterity, in all the little Matters they undertake, ſhews it ſelf extraordinary; as in buying, ſelling, and all their Domeſtick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; and not a little alſo in Publick, conſidering the Circumſtances they are in. For finding their <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Governours were ſtill too hard for
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:95495:142"/>them,<note place="margin">Priviledges.</note> and ſtill impoſing upon them, notwithſtanding the Priviledges they had capitulated for at their Surrender, and dearly purchas'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; they about thirty Years ago, not without ſome Difficulty, and with no ſmall Coſt, obtain'd the Protection of the <hi>Kizlar Haga,</hi> or Chief of the <hi>Black Eunuchs;</hi> who thereupon is become their Patron, and whom they appeal to upon any Difficulty, or Abuſe put upon them by the <hi>Turks.</hi> It is he, that orders whom he will to be their <hi>Veivode,</hi> their <hi>Caddi,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Governours.</note> 
               <hi>Haga</hi> of the Caſtle. The <hi>Veivode</hi> receiveth the Revenue of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> and payeth to the <hi>Kizlar Haga</hi> for his place Thirty thouſand Crowns a Year; and is worth to himſelf, over and above, Five thouſand Crowns, all Charges and Expences defrai'd. He is changed every Year, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his Charge upon the beginning of <hi>March.</hi> This Revenue is raiſed out of the <hi>Cuſtoms, Caratchs, Weights</hi> of the Town, <hi>Avenies</hi> or <hi>Amerce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Tenths,</hi> and <hi>Vellanies;</hi> which are the Cups of Acorns I before ſpake of, and wherewith they Tan their Leather. Thoſe alſo, that carry any Merchandize to any Fair, as <hi>Moſcoluri,</hi> &amp;c. muſt pay him a certain Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty firſt. About fifty Years paſt, the <hi>Caratch,</hi> or <hi>Poll-money,</hi> was certain at four Dollers and a half every Head; but lately the <hi>Veivodes</hi> have raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to five Dollers here, as well as in moſt other Places of <hi>Turky.</hi> The other Officers are the <hi>Sardar;</hi> who commands the Janizaries of <hi>Athens,</hi> and of the Country Adjacent. The <hi>Spahi Aga,</hi> who commands the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hies,</hi> or <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Horſe; and holds certain Lands of the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> for that Service. The <hi>Diſdar,</hi> or <hi>Haga</hi> of the Caſtle, hath no other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, than over the <hi>Neferides,</hi> or Souldiers of the Garriſon; who have their Lodgings in the Caſtle. The <hi>Caddi</hi> is Judge of all Cauſes, and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences among them, whether between <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> or both. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> indeed endeavour to avoid the ſevere Tribunal of the <hi>Turks,</hi> as much as in them lies; and to that purpoſe have compoſed a little Body politick among themſelves.<note place="margin">Policy.</note> For having divided the Town into Eight Quarters, as I ſaid, out of every one of theſe, one of the moſt ſubſtantial, and reverend antient Men is choſen, whom they call <hi>Epitro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi.</hi> Theſe Eight moderate all Concerns in a friendly manner between <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and to theſe they commit all their Publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of moment.<note place="margin">Chief Families.</note> The <hi>Benninzellies,</hi> the <hi>Palaeologues,</hi> the <hi>Limbonai,</hi> the <hi>Perouli,</hi> and the <hi>Cavalaris,</hi> are the chief Families of <hi>Athens;</hi> and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally one out of each of theſe, is choſen <hi>Epitropos.</hi> The <hi>Chalcocondylas,</hi> whom they now call <hi>Charcondyli,</hi> are but in a low condition. <hi>Stamati Charcondyli,</hi> who is deſcended from the Hiſtorian of that Name, who wrote the Hiſtory of the <hi>Turks,</hi> is a Merchant, who lives ordinarily at <hi>Miziſtra,</hi> in the <hi>Morea;</hi> but hath a Houſe at <hi>Athens. Polimeno Zarli</hi> is alſo a Merchant, well enough to paſs, but was never <hi>Epitropus:</hi> no more than <hi>Capitanuki;</hi> who is a very civil Man, and counted Rich. But they ſeldom come to that Degree of Dignity, till they are antient grave Men, and let their Beards grow to their full length. For then they begin to be honoured with the Name, or Titles of <hi>Geronti</hi> and <hi>Archonti,</hi> and to wear a high-crown'd black Hat,<note place="margin">Habits.</note> made of ſuch kind of ſtuff, as the Turky-Carpets are, and generally the ſame Habit with the <hi>Epitropi.</hi> The ordinary Habits of the other <hi>Athenians,</hi> is only a Skull-cap; which ſometimes they turn up with white, and a long black Veſt; rarely any other colours. Over their Veſt is another looſe Coat, commonly lined
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:95495:142"/>with Furs; which they hang on their Shoulders. On their Feet and Legs they wear a thin black Boot; which they ſet in Wrinkles about their Legs. They never wear <hi>Papouches,</hi> or Slippers, like the <hi>Turks;</hi> nor <hi>Turbants.</hi> The Women wear a long Coat to their Feet, of red, or ſome other colour'd Cloth; not girded abou them, but looſe; almoſt as high as their Breaſts; and is hung on their Shoulders, with a Bodice ſewed to it, without any ſtiffneſs or ſtraitneſs. Over this they have a ſhort Veſt of Silk, or fine Woollen Cloth, and ſometimes Cloth of Gold, lined with ſome rich Fur, and adorned before with Buttons as big as Wallnuts, of beaten Silver, and ſometimes Silver gilded. Their Hair cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly plaited, and braided down behind, as low as the bending of their Knees; having alſo, for the moſt part, Taſſels of leſſer Silver-Buttons, tied to the ends of the Braids. When they go to Church, they cover their Faces with a thin Linnen Vail.</p>
            <p>Although the little Hope the <hi>Athenians</hi> have, of ever gaining their Liberty from the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Tyranny, conſtrains them to live peaceably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Government, without running into Rebellion againſt them, or ſomenting any Factions in the State; yet does their old Humour of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie ſtill continue: which, though they wiſely moderate by Reaſon ſo far, as not to be tranſported thereby into any Publick Mutiny againſt the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> they now owne for their Emperour; yet they forbear not to ſhew themſelves ſenſible of the Injuries committed by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and to complain of them; and, with notable Induſtry, to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Vindication of their own Right. An Example of which, not unworthy of Obſervation, happened about the time we were there. The <hi>Veivode,</hi> new come into his Place, to get up the Sum of Money he had lately parted with to the <hi>Kizlar Haga</hi> for his Office, moſt greedily and tyrannically, without regard either to Right or Wrong, impoſed new Cuſtoms and Taxes upon them, and their Merchandizes: and to that effect was aſſiſted by the <hi>Haga</hi> of the Caſtle, and three others, that were Brothers, and principal <hi>Hagaes</hi> of <hi>Athens;</hi> who, conſpiring together, brought the poor <hi>Athenians</hi> daily into ſome troubleſom <hi>Aveny</hi> or other, meerly to get Money out of them. This they could by no means long endure; but ſoon took Counſel together, and ſent two of the Family of <hi>Limbona</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with large Preſents to the <hi>Kizlar Haga;</hi> who immediately, upon hearing their Complaint, laid a great Fine upon the <hi>Veivode,</hi> diſpoſſeſſed the <hi>Haga</hi> of the Caſtle, and ſent the three other <hi>Hagaes,</hi> their Aſſiſtants, to the Gallies. So the <hi>Limbonaies</hi> return'd tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly, to the great Mortification of the <hi>Turks</hi> in the Town, and Satisfaction of the <hi>Athenians.</hi> Some of the <hi>Greeks</hi> alſo, who betrayed their Truſt in this Affair, fearing ſome Diſgrace would befal them upon that ſcore, durſt not any more appear abroad; eſpecially <hi>Jani Bennin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zelli,</hi> who retired to the Convent of <hi>Penteli.</hi> This they did without noiſe before, or much boaſting afterwards, leſt they ſhould exaſperate the <hi>Turks</hi> dwelling among them. But indeed, they never ſhewed their Spirits more, than in this <hi>Rencounter;</hi> which they carried on with ſuch Unanimity, and good Succeſs, that its probable, the ſucceeding Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours will be more cautious, how they treat them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Athens</hi> is an Arch-Biſhoprick,<note place="margin">Of the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>epiſcopal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</note> unto whoſe Province belong the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks of <hi>Salona, Libadia, Bodinitza,</hi> and <hi>Thalanta. Bodinitza</hi> is in the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:95495:143"/>way between <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> beyond the <hi>Thermopylae.

The Arch-Biſhop himſelf owned, when we were to wait on him.<note place="margin">Who then Arch-Biſhop.</note> The Arch-Biſhop, that then reigned, was called <hi>Antenos,</hi> a Native of the <hi>Morea;</hi> and is eſteemed among them a wiſe, and learned Man: which, in my Opinion, he made the greateſt Proof of, when he refuſed the Dignity of the Patriarchal-Seat of their Church. For though that be a far greater Honour, and is much canva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for by the <hi>Grecian</hi> Metropolitans; yet all things conſidered, the Profit is not ſo great, as to deſerve that they ſhould ſo ſtrive for it: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as their preſent Condition is, a Charge of great Perplexity and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. He underſtands the antient <hi>Greek</hi> moderately well,<note place="margin">His Learning.</note> and hath read, as they ſay, ſome of the Fathers: But I found him much Latinized. He told me, He was one of thoſe, that ſigned the <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> lately made by the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and ſome other <hi>Grecian</hi> Biſhops, then preſent. He is a Man very much reſpected here, and lives more at his Eaſe, than any of his Quality I have obſerved in <hi>Greece:</hi> Although all Chriſtians there, pay a wonderful deal of Reſpect to their Biſhops, and whole Clergy. I wiſh, I could ſay half ſo much, of the Laity of <hi>England;</hi> who, in all Gratitude, ought to ſhew it, being ſo extreamly more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to our Clergy, than they are to theirs. He hath ſome three or four <hi>Caloires,</hi> to wait upon him; and hath a good Houſe upon the Hill, near the Weſt end of the Caſtle; which, they ſay, belonged to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Denis</hi> the <hi>Areopagite:</hi> where he entertain'd us civilly, receiving us after the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Faſhion; that is, making us ſit upon a <hi>Sopha,</hi> and drink <hi>Coffee</hi> with him. He told us, He had a conſiderable number of Manuſcripts; but had ſent the greateſt part of them to the Convent of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Luca.</hi> He ſhewed us only one, being S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Dionyſius</hi> his Works, with the Comment of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Maximus,</hi> well written upon Vellom; and, as we judged by the hand, five or ſix hundred Years old. The Ambaſſador of <hi>France</hi> offer'd him fifty Dollers for it; but he eſteemed it more. My Comrade, and I found two other Copies of the ſame Author, that coſt leſs Money, and pleaſed us as well.</p>
            <p>They count to the number of Two hundred Churches,<note place="margin">Churches.</note> in, and about <hi>Athens;</hi> whereof Fifty two have their particular Prieſts belonging to them; wherein they ordinarily read their Liturgies; the reſt are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom uſed, but upon certain times, and days of the Founders, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactours; and are but as ſo many Oratories, or ſmall Chapels. The <hi>Catholicon,</hi> as they call their Cathedral Church, is ſituated on the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Town, between S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>John</hi>'s Pillars, and the <hi>Baſar</hi>-Street. It is the beſt kept in repair, and the beſt adorn'd of any; although, in
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:95495:143"/>reality, but mean; and ſuch, as for Statelineſs, and Magnificence of Fabrick, would be found to exceed very few ordinary Pariſh-Churches in <hi>England;</hi> only it is indifferently well adorn'd, according to their Mode. They had their Pictures, and carving of their Skreen done at <hi>Venice.</hi> The Skreen ſeparates the Body of the Church from the Holy-place; on the top of which ſtand four Storks, made of gilded Wood, put there for Ornament, or to ſignify the Piety and Care of good Biſhops and Paſtors, who watch over their Flocks out of true and tender Love to their Souls, and not for Lucre ſake only. For they uſe no carved Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, to do any Reverence to them. Here I ſaw the Arch-Biſhop waſh the Feet of his Prieſts, in imitation of our Bleſſed Saviour's Humility, on <hi>Maundy-Thurſday,</hi> at his Inſtitution of the Holy Sacrament. The Ceremony is thus performed: Twelve of the Eldeſt <hi>Pappaes</hi> of the Town, accompany the Arch-Biſhop to the Church; where he is veſted in a Violet-colour'd Robe, and ſeated on his Throne, until ſome part of the Service is paſt: after which he deſcendeth, and entreth into the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Place, with the Twelve Prieſts, that attended him thither: and then changing the Robe he had on for another more Rich, returneth again to his Throne. The Prieſts alſo have their ſeveral colour'd Robes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting each of them his particular Apoſtle. Out of theſe, ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Old Man, with white Head and Beard, is choſen to repreſent S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peter;</hi> who ſitteth firſt of the Twelve, and on the right hand: There is alſo ſome other, red bearded, or ill-look'd Fellow appointed to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Judas.</hi> Some while after this, the Biſhop retires himſelf; and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off his rich Robes, tieth a Linnen Towel about him, and with a Baſin of Water in his hand, cometh to the Apoſtles, and offers to waſh their Feet. But he that repreſenteth S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peter,</hi> riſeth up, and refuſeth to be waſhed; uſing thoſe words of the Apoſtle in the Goſpel, <hi>John</hi> 13.9. <hi>Lord, thou ſhalt never waſh my Feet.</hi> To which the Biſhop, repreſenting Chriſt, anſwereth in thoſe words of our Saviour's, related in the Goſpel; <hi>If I waſh thee not, thou haſt no part with me.</hi> Upon which the Prieſt ſits down, and permits Chriſt to waſh his Feet, exactly according to the Dialogue that is in the Goſpel, touching this matter. But coming to <hi>Judas,</hi> the Biſhop maketh a little ſtop, and pauſeth a while, as willing to give the Traytor time, better to conſider what he was going about; and then, in concluſion, he waſheth his Feet alſo. Then with ſome <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thems</hi> and <hi>Collects,</hi> they conclude the Ceremony.</p>
            <p>We could by no means tell, why the <hi>French</hi> Author of <hi>Old and New Athens,</hi> ſhould dream, That this was the Temple of <hi>Vulcan:</hi> For we ſound nothing antient to ſhew it, nor any Tradition to confirm it, more than the Product of his Fancy: No more could we at the <hi>Moſque,</hi> ſome diſtance Eaſt from it, ſee any reaſon to make us call it <hi>The Temple of Venus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rania;</hi> although ſuch a Temple might probably have been at that End of the Town, which <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſaith, was called <hi>The Gardens,</hi> towards th <hi>I yeaeum;</hi> of which I ſhall ſpeak hereafter. The reſt of the Churches above-mentioned, as in or near to <hi>Athens,</hi> have nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary in them; only being, for the moſt part, compoſed of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Fragments, there are often found Inſcriptions about them.</p>
            <p>They have ſeveral Convents, ſome for Men, and ſome for Nuns,<note place="margin">Convents.</note> they call <hi>Calogrega's.</hi> One of theſe is ſituated on the Eaſt-ſide of the Town:
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:95495:144"/>where I was admitted to ſee the Body of a Woman, they eſteem a Saint, upon the ground of ſome <hi>Viſions,</hi> and <hi>Apparitions,</hi> they confidently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that they have had concerning her, ſince her Death. The <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins</hi> have a little <hi>Hoſpitium,</hi> or Cell here, adjoyning to the <hi>Lanthorn of Demoſthenes;</hi> where a Miſſionary or two of that Order, do reſide. The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> once had the like; but they, not finding the Employment they look'd for, procur'd themſelves to be removed to <hi>Negropont.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> have five <hi>Moſques</hi> here;<note place="margin">Moſques.</note> four in the Town, and one in the Caſtle. The <hi>Moſque</hi> of the <hi>Bazar,</hi> in the middle of the Town, is the beſt of them. But that in the Caſtle, transform'd from <hi>Minerva</hi>'s Temple to the uſe of a <hi>Moſque,</hi> is, without compariſon, the fineſt in the World. They have alſo a kind of Convent for Votaries in their Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition.</p>
            <p>There are alſo three or four publick <hi>Bagnio's,</hi> or Baths, much uſed here,<note place="margin">Bagnio's.</note> as in moſt other eminent Towns in <hi>Turky.</hi> The Town is well wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by Chanels under ground,<note place="margin">Water.</note> brought from the <hi>Iliſſus</hi> and <hi>Eridanus:</hi> I mean, from Mount <hi>Hymettus;</hi> and diſperſed about the City into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral publick Fountains, and private Houſes. That in the Street of the <hi>Bazar,</hi> is the moſt eminent, and bears the Name of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſſin Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All ſorts of Proviſions are good cheap here;<note place="margin">Proviſions.</note> whether Corn, Wine, Oyl, Mutton, Beef, Goats-Fleſh, Fiſh, or Fowl; eſpecially Partridges and Hares are in great abundance here: And ſhould any Scarcity happen, the <hi>Morea,</hi> not far diſtant, and the fat Plains of <hi>Boeotia,</hi> as near at hand, would be able to furniſh them. They fiſh with a little Light in their Boat, which the Fiſhes ſeeing, follow; which the Fiſherman perceiving, preſently ſtrikes the Fiſh with a <hi>Trident,</hi> like to that they paint <hi>Neptune</hi> with, and ſuch as is found ſtamped in many antient Medals. The Men are ſo dextrous at this Sport, that they ſeldom miſs a Stroke, and catch great quantities of Fiſh in one Night. We gave Orders for ſome to be caught for us, in the Lent, and they brought us the next Morning three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore pound weight of ſeveral ſorts of admirable good Fiſh, ſuch as I do not remember to have ſeen in our Seas; and ſold us it for leſs than a Penny a pound: and yet they made us pay ſomewhat more, than they uſually ſell it for, becauſe it was caught on purpoſe for us.</p>
            <p>Their Wine alſo is very good here;<note place="margin">Wine.</note> but they put a little Pitch in it, to preſerve it; which is not very pleaſant, until one is uſed to it.</p>
            <p>Their Olives too are excellent good; eſpecially one ſort of them, which they call <hi>Colybades;</hi> becauſe they ſtill peel them. Theſe they eſteem very much, being near as big as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Olives; yet not of quite ſo oval a Figure; but rather of the ſhape of a <hi>Jujuba.</hi> They are a ſort of Olives, that will never come to be ripe there; and therefore are pickled green: but ſo well eſteemed, that many of them are carried to the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Court, as a great rarity.</p>
            <p>The Trade of <hi>Athens</hi> is but ſmall at preſent,<note place="margin">Trade.</note> and conſiſts moſtly in little Matters among themſelves. But it would ſoon be greater, had they Vent for their Commodities. A Liſt of what they export, and their Prizes, were given me by <hi>Conſul Giraud;</hi> who aſſured me, That if Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants would ſend Veſſels thither, they would find great Profit.</p>

            <p>Turky-Leather, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Boufeloes,</hi> and thoſe according to their big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and goodneſs, <hi>Fourteen</hi> or <hi>Fifteen Dollers</hi> the Quintal.</p>
            <p>Four or five ſorts of Raw Silk, fine and courſe, are made here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pernocochi,</hi> which I think is Scarlet-grains for dying, <hi>Two Dollers</hi> the <hi>Oka;</hi> which is about Forty two Ounces.</p>

               <hi>Pitch, Tar,</hi> and <hi>Roſin,</hi> about Three Shillings the Quintal.</p>

               <hi>Cake-Sope</hi> very good, at <hi>Three Dollers</hi> the Quintal.</p>
            <p>And ſeveral other ſorts of Merchandizes; which, being leſs conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, I omit.</p>
            <p>The Merchandizes, which bear beſt Prices to be imported there, are theſe which follow:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth they call <hi>Londroes,</hi> are ſold ordinarily at <hi>Seventy</hi> and <hi>Eighty Dollers</hi> the Piece; and the more fine, the better Price they bear, in proportion. The proper colours for theſe parts are Red, Blue, Green, Black, Purple, and Violet.</p>
            <p>Tin will give <hi>Thirty five,</hi> and <hi>Thirty eight Dollers</hi> the Quintal.</p>
            <p>Lead, <hi>Seven</hi> or <hi>Eight Dollers</hi> the Quintal.</p>
            <p>Pepper, <hi>Thirty</hi> or <hi>Thirty two Dollers</hi> the Quintal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sugar, at <hi>Twenty two Dollers</hi> the Quintal.</p>
            <p>Cinamon and Cloves ſell but few here. Theſe laſt are worth <hi>Seven</hi> or <hi>Eight Dollers</hi> the <hi>Oka;</hi> the other, <hi>Five</hi> or <hi>Six.</hi>

            <p>I was willing to be thus particular upon the Account of the <hi>Conſul;</hi> who deſired me to encourage our Merchants, to ſend Ships thither.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tartans</hi> of <hi>Murſeilles</hi> come often hither; but <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships ſeldom. Yet our <hi>Conſid</hi> expected one, when we were there; which came juſt as I parted thence. I ſaw it come into the <hi>Saronique</hi> Gulph: but did not believe, it came from <hi>England;</hi> otherwiſe I had laded more Marbles on it, than the <hi>Conſul</hi> did by my Order.</p>
            <p>How famous <hi>Athens</hi> hath been for Learning, is unknown to none,<note place="margin">Learning.</note> that know any thing of antient Learning; and concerning this Subject, I have already given, in general, an Account of its preſent low conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as of all <hi>Greece.</hi> But here I will be yet more particular; and ſince I may without Vanity ſay, I went to School at <hi>Athens,</hi> I will alſo ſhew you, how I learned my Book there, beginning with <hi>ABC,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding as far as I learned. The <hi>Greeks</hi> uſe near upon the ſame Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, that is ordinarily in uſe among us; yet not without ſome Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. But as to the Pronunciation, when they read the Scholaſtick <hi>Greek,</hi> they differ very much from the ordinary way, that our Schools
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:95495:145"/>teach. Whether their Pronunciation or ours, is trueſt, that is, moſt agreeable to the Antient, I will not diſpute, much leſs take upon me to determine: ſince no Art hath yet been found out, to preſerve Sounds without Corruption or Alteration. But I will tell you, how at preſent they pronounce their Letters, and Syllables, comparing them with our preſent Characters.</p>

            <p>Χ <hi>[X]</hi> is pronounced with an Aſpiration in the Throat; that is very difficult to us <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to pronounce. Indeed, I know none that have any thing near like it, except <hi>Welſh-men, Hebrews,</hi> and <hi>Florentins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is all I obſerved, concerning their pronouncing of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants and Vowels.</p>
            <p>Their Diphthongs are thus: Αι is E, Αυ is <hi>Af,</hi> Ευ is <hi>Ef,</hi> Ου is <hi>Ou,</hi> or rather as our double <hi>oo;</hi> as we pronounce the words, <hi>Book, Look, Boots:</hi> not as in the words, <hi>Out, Bound, Stout,</hi> or <hi>South,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Differences I can call to mind, at preſent. I might here add the <hi>Variety of Characters</hi> I have obſerved in the <hi>Greek,</hi> both Antient and Modern; but I will not now too far treſpaſs upon my Reader's Patience. I will only ſay, It were to be wiſh'd, that our Schools would teach the Modern way of pronouncing <hi>Greek,</hi> as well as the Antient. For it would be a great Help to thoſe that travel into thoſe Parts, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be underſtood of the Modern <hi>Greeks</hi> at home. And who knows, but in time it may pleaſe God to excite the Piety of ſome good Men, to go and preach the Purity, and Sincerity of the Holy Goſpel to thoſe poor Chriſtians; who ſeem, at preſent, to be buried in Ignorance, and overwhelmed with <hi>Roman</hi> Superſtition, whoſe Sectators encompaſs Sea and Land, to gain Proſelytes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> ſeem to retain more of the Antient <hi>Greek</hi> in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, than the reſt of the Modern <hi>Greeks</hi> do; and have abundance of <hi>Greek</hi> words, which thoſe, who have had great Converſe with the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talians,</hi> uſe not: But yet they do not well underſtand the Antient <hi>Greek.</hi> For when we were at <hi>Athens,</hi> there was only the Arch-Biſhop, who is ſince dead, and my Maſter <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Cyriani;</hi> who were known to underſtand it. This laſt hath indeed more Learning, than I thought to meet with at <hi>Athens;</hi> for he underſtands <hi>Latine</hi> competently well, and ſomething alſo in <hi>Philoſophy;</hi> but ſeems not to have ſtudied <hi>Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> over much. He practiſes <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and is a civil and ingenious Man, how much ſoever ſome ſcandalize him, becauſe he ſeldom frequenteth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany:
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:95495:146"/>the Reaſon whereof I found to be, becauſe he is, indeed, no great Lover of the <hi>Greekiſh</hi> Superſtitions. There is another <hi>Greek,</hi> Native of <hi>Candia,</hi> called Signior <hi>Georgio,</hi> an honeſt Man, and an Undertaker in Phyſick too, who underſtands Scholaſtick <hi>Greek</hi> a little. But as to the reſt, I think there are few, that underſtand it any more, than an <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> does naturally underſtand <hi>Latine.</hi> 'Tis true, there are but few a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, who have wherewithal to live, but will learn, while they are young, to write and read, whether <hi>Spirituals,</hi> or <hi>Seculars.</hi> The only <hi>Greek</hi> Sermon I heard, was at <hi>Athens</hi> upon <hi>Eaſter</hi> Monday; which the Arch-Biſhop pronounced from his Throne. And it was an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary thing, ſince they are not much uſed to Sermons there. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is only to read <hi>Homilies,</hi> appointed long ſince for ſet Holy-days, and Feaſts: the Language whereof is now alſo, with time, ſo antiquated, that they are hardly underſtood by Vulgar Auditors.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Athenians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Manners.</note> notwithſtanding the long Poſſeſſion, that Barbariſme hath had of this Place, ſeem to be much more poliſhed, in point of Manners and Converſation, than any other of theſe Parts; being civil, and of reſpectful Behaviour to all, and highly Complemental in their Diſcourſe. They ſtill ſpeak to one another in the Third Perſon, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluentia Sou, Your Lordſhip,</hi> as the <hi>Italians</hi> do in their <hi>Vos Signioria;</hi> and never meet, without giving the time of the Day, or uſing ſome good Wiſh. Their Wives go but little abroad, and their Daughters never, as I could hear, till they go to the Church to be Married. Their Wives come to Church <hi>Sundays</hi> and <hi>Holy-days;</hi> but mix not with the Men, when they are there: For moſt of their Churches are divided into Three Iſles; the Men ſtand in the Middle, and the Women on each hand of the Men by themſelves; or in ſome Churches, above in Galleries, with a Lattice before them. The moſt that I at any time ſaw, was on <hi>Eaſter-Sunday,</hi> early in the Morning; when at each Pariſh-Church all were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, to celebrate the Reſurrection; among whom were many ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handſom Women, who looked very graceful in their manner of dreſs; but ſo horribly painted, that it was hard to conjecture what their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Complexion was; by reaſon of the thick Vizard of Paint they had on.</p>
            <p>Their Ceremony this Day is notable in all their Pariſh-Churches.<note place="margin">Eaſter.</note> For after the Goſpel, and Anthem, called, <gap reason="foreign">

This pious Solemnity, when I was there, had like to have been a little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd by a profane <hi>Italian</hi> Merchant of <hi>Tine;</hi> who being then as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> upon occaſion of bringing ſome Merchandizes, eſpecially a ſort of Powder, wherewith the Women uſed to die their Hands and Nails; and ſeeing the Men begin to ſalute one another, told our <hi>Conſul</hi> aloud, <hi>He hoped, when the Men had done, they ſhould kiſs the Women round alſo.</hi> But receiving from the <hi>Conſul</hi> an Anſwer ſuitable to his Folly, it gave a Check to his profane Drollery. At <hi>Eaſter,</hi> what ever Differences are, or have been depending betwixt Man and Man the Year before, they muſt now reconcile themſelves, or be accounted by the reſt of the Church, <hi>as bad as Heathens.</hi> This Ceremony done on <hi>Eaſter-day</hi> in each Pariſh-Church, is the next Day celebrated in the Cathedral; the <hi>Pappa</hi>
               <pb n="357" facs="tcp:95495:146"/>ſending Wax-Candles to the Principal Men of his Pariſh, and the Arch-Biſhop to the moſt conſiderable of the City, or thoſe they will ſhew any Reſpect unto; who thereupon meet him at the Church with the Candles lighted. From <hi>Eaſter</hi> till <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> not only in the Church, but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they meet any they know to be Chriſtians, eſpecially if they be of their Acquaintance, they ſalute each other; the one ſaying, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>When a Virgin is to be married, ſhe is brought to the Church,<note place="margin">Marriage.</note> as richly attired as the Fortune of her Relations will bear; but her Face is ſo bedaubed with groſs Paint, that it is not eaſie to determine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe be Fleſh and Blood, or a Statue made of Plaiſter. She returns home from the Church to the Houſe of her Husband, with a great Crown of gilded Metal on her Head, accompanied by all the Gueſts, and her near Relations, with Pipes, and Hand Drums, and the beſt Muſick they can make: whil'ſt ſhe, in the mean time, is conducted ſo ſlow a pace, that it is ſcarcely perceivable, that ſhe moveth: And ſo ſoon as ſhe is entred into the Houſe of her Spouſe, they throw Sugar-Plumbs out at the Windows, upon the People, who are crowded and throng'd at the Door.</p>
            <p>As to the eminent Monuments of Antiquity, yet remaining at <hi>Athens,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Antiquities.</note> I dare prefer them before any Place in the World, <hi>Rome</hi> only excepted. Therefore I will in the next place conſider them, giving you the beſt and trueſt Account my Obſervations will enable me; beginning our Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, firſt, with the <hi>Acropolis,</hi> or Caſtle; being ſituated in the midſt of all the reſt, and the moſt antient and eminent Part of <hi>Athens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Acropolis,</hi> or Caſtle, is built upon a long Rock, with Precipices every way from it, except on the North-Weſt end; where you mount by a ſteep Aſcent, to the Entrance; and which is better fortified than the reſt, by high and thick Walls. The whole Rock, which is Oval, is about Twelve hundred ordinary Paces in circumference, and alſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Walls of very antient Work, eſpecially the Foundations of it, making an <hi>Area</hi> twice as long as broad. About Two hundred Paces lower, yet not quite to the bottom of the Hill, are diſtinctly to be ſeen the Foundations of other Walls, encompaſſing the firſt almoſt quite round: which I believe to be thoſe built by <hi>Theſeus,</hi> who firſt enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the City. One Gate of which ſtandeth on the South-ſide, and two others, conſiſting of vaſt Stones, on the North, and North-Eaſt ſides; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Walls themſelves are almoſt even with the Ground. And it may be demonſtrated both by the Monuments of Antiquity yet remaining, and out of Hiſtory, that <hi>Athens</hi> had yet a far greater Wall, than either of theſe, including this ſecond Wall, and encompaſſing the whole City; ſpread out far and wide above it; to which two other long Walls, one reaching to <hi>Pyraea,</hi> and the other <hi>Phalarea,</hi> were joined, as hath been ſaid. It was with great difficulty, we obtain'd the Favour of ſeeing the Caſtle of the <hi>Haga;</hi> who being newly come thither, and ſcarce well ſettled in his Place, knew not whether he might ſafely gratify us. But an old Souldier of the Caſtle, his Friend and Conſident, for three <hi>Oka's</hi> of <hi>Coffee,</hi> two to the Governour, and one to himſelf, perſwaded him at laſt to give way; aſſuring him, it was never refuſed to ſuch Strangers,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:95495:147"/>as it appear'd that we were. The <hi>Haga</hi> hath for his Garriſon about an hundred <hi>Turks</hi> of the Country, who reſide there with their Families; and are always on their Guard, for fear of Pirats, who often land there, and do a great deal of Miſchief. Wherefore all Night, a part of them by turns, go the Rounds of the Walls, making a great hallowing and noiſe, to ſignifie their Watchfulneſs, and that if Pirats, or other Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies come, they are ready to receive them. Theſe Soldiers are called <hi>Neferides,</hi> or <hi>Iſarlides</hi> in <hi>Turkiſh,</hi> and <hi>Caſtriani</hi> in <hi>Greek;</hi> not <hi>Janizaries.</hi> I eſteem this Caſtle of no great Strength for theſe Times; and that by reaſon of the Hill <hi>Muſaeum,</hi> which lieth South-Weſt of it, of equal height with it, and being within Cannon-ſhot.</p>
            <p>We went up to the Caſtle from the Town, mounting by degrees, and winding about it, till we came at the Entrance, which is at the North-Weſt end of the Rock. Within the firſt Gate I obſerv'd, in the Walls, two Figures in <hi>Baſſo-relievo,</hi> that joyned hands; which we gueſſed to be a Man, and his Wife, giving to each other their laſt Farewel, as is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeen in antient Monuments; with this word in <hi>Latine, Vale;</hi> and in <hi>Greek,</hi> XAIPE, or <hi>Adieu.</hi> Thence mounting a little further, through a narrow Court, with a Covert on the ſide of it for the Guards, we came to the ſecond Gate, over which is a <hi>Tranſeant</hi> of Marble, with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription on it of one <hi>Flavius Marcellinus,</hi> that rebuilt the Gates of the Town at his own Charges: Perhaps, meaning only the Gates of the <hi>Acro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis;</hi> for that, as <hi>Thucydides</hi> obſerves, was called the City alſo, after the reſt was built.</p>
            <q>

            </q>
            <p>When we had paſſed the Second Gate, we obſerved ſome antient Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations; which we gueſſed, might be of the <hi>Propylaea,</hi> or <hi>Outward Gate:</hi> which was ſo glorious a Structure, that it's ſaid to have coſt a Million of <hi>Drachma's</hi> to build it. Thence, through another ſmall Court, the way brought us to the Third Gate; over which was a <hi>Baſſo-relievo</hi> of an Eagle, the Enſign of the <hi>Roman</hi> Sovereignty: the Goodneſs of whoſe Work ſhews it to be antient. After we had paſſed this Gate, we were quite within the <hi>Acropolis;</hi> where the firſt thing we obſerved, was a little Temple on our right hand; which we knew to be that dedicated to <hi>Victory without Wings.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Suidas <hi>in</hi>

                  </gap>.</note> It is built of white Marble, with one end near the Wall; where 'tis ſaid, that <hi>Aegeus</hi> caſt himſelf down at the ſight of the Black Sails, his Son <hi>Theſeus</hi> forgot to change, when he returned Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious from the Combate with the Minotaur in <hi>Crete.</hi> It was therefore ſtiled <hi>Without Wings;</hi> becauſe the Fame thereof arrived not at <hi>Athens,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Theſeus</hi> himſelf, that brought it. For otherwiſe, Victory uſed ſtill to be repreſented <hi>with Wings.</hi> This Temple is not above fifteen Foot long, and about eight or nine broad: But of white Marble, with chanel'd Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the <hi>Dorick</hi> Order. The Architrave hath a <hi>Baſſo-relievo</hi> on it, of little Figures well cut; and now ſerveth the <hi>Turks</hi> for a Magazin of Powder.</p>
            <pb n="359" facs="tcp:95495:147"/>
            <p>Almoſt over againſt this, is another noble Edifice of white Marble; which hath the Reputation to have been the Armory of <hi>Lycurgus;</hi> and, they ſay, was uſed for an Armory many Years together, both by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>Turks:</hi> until about twenty Years ago, it was blown up by Gun-powder kept in it; for which the <hi>Greeks</hi> keep an Anniverſary Thanks-giving-day: telling, That a certain <hi>Haga</hi> of the Caſtle, a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Enemy to Chriſtianity, reſolved one day to batter down a Church; who having prepared all things in readineſs over Night to do the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Execution next day, being a Feſtival according to their Law, they meant thus maliciouſly to celebrate, by the Ruin of a Chriſtian Church: But were the ſame Night miraculouſly prevented by Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from Heaven; which ſet the Powder on Fire, and blew part of the Roof, whereon the <hi>Haga's</hi> Houſe ſtood, together with him, and his whole Family, up into the Air; a Girl only excepted, who was ſaved, and is ſince married to a <hi>Turk</hi> of <hi>Athens.</hi> The next day they found Bows and Arrows, Shields, and other Armour, all about the Country: But ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard they any News of the <hi>Haga</hi> again. The Walls of the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing held faſt, being of white Marble, very thick, and ſtrongly cemented together; yet were they ſo crack't in ſome Places, that one may thruſt ones hand through them. But that part of the Building towards the Front, which looketh Weſtwards, received no harm, either Walls or Roof. The whole Structure is white Marble, and you mount up to it by five or ſix ſteps; whereof only one remains entire. The <hi>Eagle</hi> of the Front is faſhioned like other Temples, ſuſtained by four Pillars of the <hi>Dorick</hi> Order<note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Eagle</hi> is the high Angle of the Front of a Temple, where the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Eagle</hi> uſed to be placed.</note>. On each hand this Front, are placed two ſquare Turrets, whoſe ſides next the Steps are ſuſtained by Pillars of the ſame Order, as they yet remain on the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Tower: above which is built now the <hi>Haga's</hi> Lodgings; but the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Tower is ruined, and hath another high one built upon its antient Foundations, appearing ſome Ranges of Stone above Ground. The reſt is a mixture of broken Rubbiſh, raiſed upon it a good height: But one may conclude, there were antiently two very beautiful Towers raiſed on them. The <hi>Pronaae</hi> is a large ſquare Room, whoſe Roof within is held up by four beautiful <hi>Ionick</hi> Pillars, ſuſtaining two great Marble Beams, which are covered with large Marble Planks. But whether this was that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that Building, which <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſaith, is on the left hand of the <hi>Propylaea,</hi> full of Pictures, or painted Work, is hard to ſay; and as hard to determin, that it was indeed a Temple. For thoſe Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Towers on each hand of the Front, is a thing extraordinary, and what I never ſaw belonging to any Temple. Beſides this, although it is on the left hand of the Temple of <hi>Victory,</hi> it is that which preſents it ſelf to view before it. The Towers on each ſide of the Front, perſwade me very much, that it was the famous <hi>Propylaea.</hi>

I wiſh, I could communicate the Pleaſure I took in viewing it, by a Deſcription, that would in ſome proportion expreſs the <hi>Ideas</hi> I had then of it: which I cannot hope to do; but ſhall give you the Figure I took of it there, with its Dimenſions, and ſo much of the Sculpture, as I can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>This Temple is called by <hi>Panſanias, Parthenion;</hi> becauſe the Goddeſs <hi>Minerva,</hi> to whom it was dedicated, profeſſed Virginity. It is ſituated about the middle of the Cittadel, and conſiſts altogether of admirable white Marble. The Plane of it is above twice as long, as it is broad; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Two hundred, and ſeventeen foot, nine inches long, and ninety eight foot, ſix inches broad. It hath an Aſcent, every way, of five Degrees, or Steps; which ſeem to be ſo contrived, to ſerve as a <hi>Baſis</hi> to the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tico;</hi> which is ſupported by chanelled Pillars of the <hi>Dorick</hi> Order, ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted round upon them, without any other <hi>Baſis.</hi> Theſe Pillars are For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſix in number, being eight to the Front, and as many behind, and ſeventeen on each ſide, counting the four corner ones twice over, to be deducted. They are Forty two foot high, and ſeventeen foot and a half about. The Diſtance between Pillar and Pillar, is ſeven foot, and four inches. This <hi>Portico</hi> beareth up a Front, and Frize round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Temple, charged with Hiſtorical Figures of admirable Beauty and Work. The Figures of the Front, which the Antients called the <hi>Eagle,</hi> appear, though from that height, of the natural bigneſs; being
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:95495:148"/>in entire <hi>Relievo,</hi> and wonderfully well carved. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſaith no more of them, than that they concern the Birth of the Goddeſs <hi>Minerva.</hi> What I obſerved, and remember of them, is this.</p>
            <p>There is a Figure, that ſtands in the middle of it, having its right Arm broken, which probably held the Thunder. Its Legs ſtradle at ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from each other; where, without doubt, was placed the <hi>Eagle:</hi> For its Beard, and the Majeſty, which the Sculpture hath expreſſed in his Countenance, although thoſe other uſual Characters be wanting here, do ſufficiently ſhew it to have been made for <hi>Jupiter.</hi> He ſtands na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; for ſo he was uſually repreſented, eſpecially by the <hi>Greeks.</hi> At his right hand is another Figure, with its Hands and Arms broken off, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered down half way the Leg, in a poſture as coming towards <hi>Jupiter;</hi> which, perhaps, was a <hi>Victory,</hi> leading the Horſes of the Triumphant Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot of <hi>Minerva,</hi> which follows it. The Horſes are made with ſuch great Art, that the Sculptor ſeems to have outdone himſelf, by giving them a more than ſeeming Life: ſuch a Vigour is expreſs'd in each poſture of their prauncing, and ſtamping, natural to generous Horſes. <hi>Minerva</hi> is next repreſented in the Chariot, rather as the Goddeſs of <hi>Learning,</hi> than <hi>War,</hi> without Helmet, Buckler, or a <hi>Meduſa's</hi> Head on her Breaſt, as <hi>Pauſanias</hi> deſcribes her Image within the Temple. Next behind her, is another Figure of a Woman ſitting, with her Head broken off. Who it was, is not certain. But my Companion made me obſerve the next two Figures, ſitting in the Corner, to be of the Emperour <hi>Adrian,</hi> and his Empreſs <hi>Sabina;</hi> whom I eaſily knew to be ſo, by the many Medals and Statues I have ſeen of them.</p>
            <p>At the left hand of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> are five or ſix other Figures, my Comrade taketh to be an Aſſembly of the Gods; where <hi>Jupiter</hi> introduceth <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva,</hi> and owneth her for his Daughter. The <hi>Poſtick,</hi> or <hi>Hind-front,</hi> was adorned with Figures, expreſſing <hi>Minerva</hi>'s Conteſt with <hi>Neptune,</hi> about the naming of the City of <hi>Athens:</hi> But now all of them are fallen down, only part of a Sea-Horſe excepted. The Architrave is alſo charged with a <hi>Baſſo-relievo,</hi> at ſeveral diſtances, divided into Squares of about two or three foot broad, and three or four foot high. That towards the South, is charged, as <hi>Pauſanias</hi> affirmed, with the Repreſentation of the Wars of the Giants, who inhabited the narrow Streights of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and <hi>Pallenis;</hi> the <hi>Athenian's</hi> War with the <hi>Amazons.</hi> their Victory of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rathon,</hi> and their Conquering of the <hi>Gauls</hi> in <hi>Myſia.</hi> Where I find the Interpreter of <hi>Pauſanias</hi> hath erred, in tranſlating theſe words; <hi>In eo Arcis muro, qui ad Auſtrum verſus eſt:</hi> for it ſhould be, <hi>In eo muro,</hi> not <hi>Arcis,</hi> but <hi>Templi: In that Wall of the Temple, which is towards the South.</hi> For it is of the Temple he is diſcourſing, and of the Statues in it.

By the ſame Author I learn, That this was done by the Munificence of <hi>Attalus,</hi> King of <hi>Myſia;</hi> and the ſame, that was by the Oracle told, He ſhould be King of <hi>Leſſer Aſia,</hi> or <hi>Taurica;</hi> and whom the <hi>Athenians</hi> honoured, by calling one of their Tribes after his Name; of whoſe Riches, and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, <hi>Suidas</hi> telleth great things. But it was <hi>Pericles,</hi> that firſt built this Temple, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Cato</hi> telleth, and employed <hi>Jctimus</hi> and <hi>Callicrates,</hi> for his Architects: Which, perhaps, was meant by him only
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:95495:149"/>of the <hi>Cella,</hi> or Body of the Temple; to which <hi>Attalus</hi> added this Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent <hi>Portico.</hi> But the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> moſt probably repaired it, and adorn'd it with thoſe Figures at each Front. For the whiteneſs of the Marble, and his own Statue joyned with them, apparently ſhew them to be of a later Age, than the firſt, and done by that Emperours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Within the <hi>Portico</hi> on high, and on the outſide of the <hi>Cella</hi> of the Temple it ſelf, is another Border of <hi>Baſſo-relievo</hi> round about it, or at leaſt on the North and South-ſides; which, without doubt, is as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient as the Temple, and of admirable work; but not ſo high a <hi>Relievo;</hi> as the other. Thereon are repreſented Sacrifices, Proceſſions, and other Ceremonies of the Heathens Worſhip. Moſt of them were deſigned by the Marqueſs <hi>De Nantell;</hi> who employed a Painter to do it two Months together, and ſhewed them to us, when we waited on him at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.</hi> The <hi>Cella</hi> of the Temple without, is a Hundred and fifty eight foot long, and broad Sixty ſeven foot. Before you enter into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Temple from the Front, is the <hi>Pronaos,</hi> whoſe Roof is ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſix chanelled Pillars of the ſame order, and bigneſs with thoſe of the <hi>Portico,</hi> and contains near the third part of the <hi>Cella;</hi> to wit, Forty four foot of the length. We obſerved in place of one of the Pillars, a great pile of Stone, and Lime, of moſt rude work; which they told us, the <hi>Kizlar-Haga</hi> had ordered to be ſo done, to help to ſupport the Roof; becauſe he could never find a Stone big enough to ſupply the place of the old Pillar, broken down; although he had ſpent Two thouſand Crowns to do it.</p>
            <p>Here alſo we ſaw upon another Pillar two Inſcriptions; One was in Honour of <hi>Lucius, Egnatius, Victor, Lollianus;</hi> who had been publick Oratour at <hi>Athens:</hi> The other is of a <hi>Proconſul</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> called <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus Feſtus;</hi> whom the <hi>Athenians</hi> had honoured with the Title of <hi>Are<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>My Comrade found the ſame <hi>Rufus Feſtus</hi> by another Inſcription he met with at <hi>Rome,</hi> to have been a <hi>Roman</hi> of Quality, born at <hi>Vulſinium,</hi> a little Town in the way between <hi>Piſa</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> now called <hi>Bolſina:</hi> where his Epitaph is in Verſe, and, as he believes, of his own; becauſe he was a Poet: ſome of whoſe Works are yet extant, under the Name of <hi>Feſtus Avienus.</hi> There is alſo a great Veſſel of white Marble, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Work, which might have been a Font, to Baptize in, in time paſt: But not as Monſieur <hi>Guiliter</hi> affirmeth, for Holy-Water. For the <hi>Greeks</hi> uſe no ſuch thing in their Churches, although they do at home; being made once a Year in the Church. Here hang alſo ſome few Lamps, that the <hi>Turks</hi> carry into the Temple, when they do their Night-Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. From the <hi>Pronaos</hi> we entred into the Temple, by a long Door in the middle of the Front. But my Companion, and I were not ſo much ſurprized with the Obſcurity of it, as Monſieur <hi>Guiliter;</hi> becauſe the Obſervations we had made on other Heathen Temples, did make it no new thing unto us, as I obſerved at <hi>Spalato.</hi> And that the Heathens loved Obſcurity in their Religious Rites and Cuſtoms, many Reaſons may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; eſpecially, becauſe by that means the Pomps they expoſed to the People, had much advantage by it; and the Defects of them, with all their juggling and cheating, were leſs expoſed to view. When the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> conſecrated it to ſerve God in, they let in the Light at the Eaſt end; which is all that it yet hath. And not only that, but made a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircle for the Holy Place, according to their Rites; which the <hi>Turks</hi> have not yet much altered. This was ſeparated from the reſt by Jaſpar Pillars; two of which, on each ſide, yet remain. Within this Chancel is a Canopy, ſuſtained by four Porphyry Pillars, with beautiful white Marble Chapters, of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Order. But the Holy Table under it, is removed. Beyond the Canopy are two or three Degrees, one above another, in a Semicirle; where the Biſhops and Presbyters uſed to ſit in time of Communion, upon certain Solemn days. The Biſhop ſate in a Marble Chair, above the reſt; which yet remaineth above the Degrees, againſt the Window. Towards the bottom of this Window, are thoſe marvelous Stones Monſieur <hi>Guiliter</hi> makes ſuch a Miracle of. They are only of a tranſparent Marble; which <hi>Pliny,</hi> in the Thirtieth Book of his <hi>Natural Hiſtory,</hi> calleth <hi>Phengites;</hi> and ſaith, It was found in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> in <hi>Nero</hi>'s time, who built a Temple of it to Fortune; which was Light, when the Doors were ſhut. By reaſon of its Natural Tranſparency; an obſcure Light paſſeth through it; and ſeveral Holes being made deep in it, it makes the Light look of a reddiſh, or yellowiſh colour. But as to its ſhining in the Night, that's a Wonder was never heard of until now; and for his comparing it to the Brightneſs of a Carbuncle, it may paſs for one of his <hi>Hyperbolies;</hi> our Eyes being much too dim, to diſcover it. This ſame Author hath made many other Obſervations, whereof we could find but very little, or no probability; as the Inſcription on this Temple, <hi>To the unknown God,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> Pilgrimages to it, with ſeveral others, not worth mentioning, and hardly to be excus'd from the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of manifeſt Untruths. On both ſides, and towards the Door, is a kind of Gallery, made with two Ranks of Pillars, Twenty two below, and Twenty three above. The odd Pillar is over the Arch of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, which was left for the Paſſage. It being now turn'd into a <hi>Moſque,</hi>
               <pb n="364" facs="tcp:95495:150"/>the Niche of the <hi>Turks Devotion</hi> is made in the Corner on this ſide of the Altar, on the right hand; by which is their Place of Prayer: and on the other ſide a Pulpit, to read their Law in; as is uſual in all <hi>Moſques.</hi> The <hi>Turks,</hi> according to their meaſure of Wit, have waſhed over the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful white Marble within, with Lime. At one ſide of the Quire, there are four Preſſes made in the Wall, and ſhut up with Doors of Marble They ſay, None dares open them; and that one undertaking to do it, immediately died the firſt he opened; and that the Plague ſoon after followed in the Town. The Marqueſs of <hi>Nantell</hi> would have it attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted the ſecond time; but the ſcrupulous <hi>Turks</hi> would not permit him. They think, there is ſome Treaſure there; perhaps, there may be ſome Church-Veſtments, Books, or Plate, belonging to the Altar; which now, in the poor <hi>Greek</hi> Church, is ſeldom much above a Chalice, and a ſmall Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Plate. They ſhewed us the place, where two Orange-trees of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble had ſtood; which being taken thence to be carried to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the Veſſel miſcarried with them. The Roof over the Altar and Quire, added to the Temple by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> hath the Picture of the Holy Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin on it, of <hi>Moſaick</hi> Work, left yet by the <hi>Turks;</hi> becauſe, as they ſay, a certain <hi>Turk</hi> having ſhot a Muſquet at it, his hand preſently withered. This Temple was covered outwardly with great Planks of Stone; of which ſome are fallen down, and are to be ſeen in the <hi>Moſque.</hi> They have built a <hi>Minoret,</hi> or tall, ſlender Steeple; out of which they make a Noiſe, to call People together, at their ſet times of Prayer, day and night: On the top of which I mounted, and had a moſt pleaſing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Cittadel, City, Plain, and Gulph of <hi>Egina,</hi> with the Coaſts, and Harbours round about. But i durſt not ſtay long to enjoy the ſight, for fear of being ſeen my ſelf, and taken for one, that had other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, than of meer Curioſity. After ſome ſmall while therefore deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, we left the Temple of <hi>Minerva;</hi> having firſt made a Preſent of ſome few <hi>Timins</hi> to the <hi>Turk,</hi> who had been ſo civil to permit us ſuch a free, and fair Examination of all the Myſteries, and Rarities of it.</p>
            <p>Going therefore ſome way further,<note place="margin">TEMPLE OF ERICTHEUS.</note> amongſt the Buildings, and Ruins, on the North-ſide of the Temple of <hi>Minerva,</hi> we came to the Temple of <hi>Erictheus.</hi> It is known to be that, by two Marks out of <hi>Pauſanias:</hi> Firſt, Becauſe he ſaith, It is a <hi>Double Building,</hi> one bigger than the other, as this yet remains. The leſſer one, by which the Entrance is to the other, is Twenty nine foot long, and Twenty one foot, three inches broad. The bigger is Sixty three foot, and a half long, and Thirty ſix foot broad. Its Roof is ſuſtained by <hi>Ionick</hi> Pillars, chanelled; but the Chapters are ſomething different from any I have ſeen of that Order; and ſeem to be a kind of mixture between it, and the <hi>Dorick</hi> Order. The other Mark is, that, as <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſaith, There is a Well of Salt-Water in it; which he makes no wonder of, becauſe there are many ſuch in Inland Places, a great way from the Sea; as at <hi>Aphrodicaea</hi> in <hi>Caria,</hi> &amp;c. All that he thinks worth writing of it, was, That it made a noiſe, like the Waves of the Sea, when the South-Wind bloweth. We could not have permiſſion to go into the Temple, to ſee it; becauſe the <hi>Turk</hi> that lives in it, hath made it his <hi>Seraglio</hi> for his Women; and was then abroad. But we were aſſured, That the Well is now almoſt dry. On the South-ſide of the Temple of <hi>Minerva,</hi> we ſaw ſome antient Ruins; where are to be ſeen
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:95495:150"/>ſome Statues of Women, in the Walls; which my Comrade thinks, may be the <hi>Graces,</hi> which <hi>Socrates</hi> hath made there: Becauſe Authors expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, That although the <hi>Graces</hi> uſed ordinarily to be repreſented na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; yet <hi>Socrates</hi> made his to appear cloathed, as theſe here are. 'Tis like alſo, here was the Temple of <hi>Minerva Poliades;</hi> that is, Protectrice of the City; and the Temple of the Nymph <hi>Pandroſa;</hi> but no Remains of them are now to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as we were come out of the Caſtle,<note place="margin">THEATER of BACCHUS.</note> we turned on our left hand, and came to the <hi>Theater</hi> of <hi>Bacchus;</hi> juſt as <hi>Pauſanias</hi> deſcribes it, under the Southern-ſide of the Caſtle; upon the riſe of whoſe Rock were the Seats of the Spectators; which comprehend ſome Degrees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a Semicircle: whoſe Diameter, as Conſul <hi>Giraud</hi> meaſured it by the <hi>French</hi> Foot, is Two hundred, forty three foot; and as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Francis Vernon,</hi> in his Letter to the Royal Society, by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> Foot, is Two hundred ſixty three. I was prevented from taking all its Dimenſions exactly, becauſe I heard the <hi>Turks</hi> from the Caſtle, were very angry with the Conſul for doing it; ſo that I only paced it, and found the whole Body of the Scene, Ninety one Paces; of which the Seats take up Twenty five, on each ſide of the Scene; and the Scene it ſelf Forty five. The Scene is oblong, jetting out ſix Paces more forward in the Front, than the Seats of the Spectators.</p>
            <figure>
               <head>Lib. V. The Arca of the Theator of Bacchus</head>
            </figure>
            <p>The antient Seats are ruined; but ſome diſtinct Diſtances appear, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where they have been. The Semicircular Area below the Seats, and the Scene, are filled a good height with their own Ruins; and that which appears beſt preſerved againſt the Injuries of time, is the Front, looking towards the Sea; where three Ranges of Arches remain, one above a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. The uppermoſt were, no doubt, for Windows, and to let in the
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:95495:151"/>Air; but the lowermoſt could not reaſonably be thought ſo, becauſe they were probably even with the Ground, being now part covered under Ground without, and perfectly buried within. Beſides, the middle Arch is ſo much larger, and higher than the reſt, that it could have been no other, but the chief Entrance into the Area, and had the Scene or Stage above it. The two leſſer Arches on each ſide, might be for the ſame purpoſe, and, I ſuppoſe, lead alſo into the Area. Theſe five Arches take up the breadth of the Scene only. On each ſide of which, paſſing the Corners of the Scene, towards the ends of the Seats, are two more Arches; which, whether they were for Caves, under the degrees or ways up to them, is now too late to determine. The next Range of Arches, where the Windows began, are leſs in bigneſs; but are more in number, than the others. Over the great Arch, in the middle of the Scene, is no Window, but a little Room; ſo big as the thickneſs of the Wall, and breadth of the Door will give it leave: which my Comrade <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> forgot to mention. What was the uſe of it, I know not, unleſs for a Retreat to the Actors. On each hand of this, were three Arches; at each end of the Degrees, three more; in all twelve. The third Rank, I judge, contained as many; but are now moſt of them broken down. Above the Sears of the Spectators, is the Grotto, which <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſpeaks of here, in the Rock, under the <hi>Acropolis;</hi> in which was a <hi>Tripous,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was engraven <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> ſlaying the Children of <hi>Niobe.</hi> This Theater was antiently adorned with the Statues of their <hi>Tragedians</hi> and <hi>Comedians;</hi> of theſe <hi>Menander</hi> only was illuſtrious: but of the <hi>Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> many; among which <hi>Euripides, Sophoeles,</hi> and <hi>Aeſchylus:</hi> and the whole Fabrick was of white Marble.</p>

            <p>Above the Seats of the Spectators, we found four Inſcriptions upon little Pillars: among the reſt, one of <hi>Artemidorus,</hi> Son of <hi>Apollophanes</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaia;</hi>
               <pb n="367" facs="tcp:95495:151"/>who, perhaps, might have place amongſt the Dramatick Poets. For <hi>Apollophanes</hi> was a <hi>Comedian</hi> of <hi>Athens;</hi> whoſe Plays are numbred by <hi>Suidas.</hi> One <hi>Artemidorus</hi> is alſo mentioned by him, whom he calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; which was, probably, becauſe he put out ſome Comedies either in the Name of <hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi> or in imitation of him. The ſecond was of one <hi>Philaetus,</hi> Freeman, and Receiver of the Tax of the <hi>Twentieth;</hi> who made that Monument to his Friend <hi>Quintus Calpurnius Eutyches.</hi> The third was a Pillar of one <hi>Nicon</hi> of the <hi>Halians,</hi> a little Town of <hi>Attica,</hi> by the Sea-ſide: whether it was of that <hi>Nicon,</hi> who was the great Victor in the <hi>Athletick</hi> Games, of whom <hi>Suidas</hi> ſpeaks, I leave others to determine. The fourth was of one <hi>Cleo,</hi> or <hi>Cleon,</hi> the Son of <hi>Andronicus,</hi> of <hi>Pheneos,</hi> a Town in <hi>Arcadia.</hi> There was one of this Name, famous in <hi>Thucydides;</hi> who was Maſter of ſuch a Tongue, that he could perſwade the People to do whatſoever he had a mind to. He was their <hi>General</hi> alſo in ſeveral Expeditions; but, at laſt, ſlain in <hi>Thrace,</hi> flying with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from before <hi>Amphipolis,</hi> which he had beſieged; wherein <hi>Braſſidas</hi> was Captain of the <hi>Lacedemonians;</hi> who, though he gain'd a great Victory, and knew it before his Death, yet he ſurviv'd not long after it, but died of thoſe Wounds he received from the <hi>Athenians,</hi> in his purſuing of them.</p>
            <p>There are ſome Foundations of Arches, run along in the ſame Line with the Front of the Theater, Eaſtwards; which are ſuppoſed to be the Remains of the <hi>Portico</hi> of <hi>Eumenes,</hi> where the <hi>Tragedians</hi> gat their Plays by heart; and was the chief Walking-place in the whole Town: whither they went not only to take the Air, but to converſe with Men of Learning, to hear the News, and to divert themſelves in the company of <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and ingenious Men. From whence it was, that the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s <hi>Philoſophy</hi> were called <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> from their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputing as they walked: So alſo the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> from their Meeting in theſe Cloiſters, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to hear their Maſter <hi>Zeno,</hi> took their Name. This Foundation runs along a good way, and is backed with a Wall; above which, I ſuppoſe, the <hi>Portico</hi> was built; for the other is part of the ſecond Wall, about the <hi>Acropolis</hi> I before mentioned. To enter which you muſt go from the Theater, almoſt to the Eaſt-end of the Southern-Wall of the Caſtle; and then turn into it by an old Gate. All between this Wall, and the Caſtle, is now diſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, and turned into Corn-fields.</p>

For my Comrade hath well obſerved out of <hi>Euripides</hi> and <hi>Lucian,</hi> that the <hi>Grotto</hi> of <hi>Pan</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> was on the North-ſide of the Caſtle; and that it was under the Wall of it, called <hi>Pelaſgicon:</hi> Whereas this Church of <hi>Panagia</hi> is under the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern-Wall, called <hi>Cimonium.</hi> And one of theſe Inſcriptions ſhews, That the People gave the Play at the time, when <hi>Pitharotus</hi> was <hi>Archon;</hi> and that <hi>Thraſycles,</hi> Son of <hi>Thraſyllus,</hi> of the Town of <hi>Dicelia,</hi> of the Tribe <hi>Hippothoon,</hi> being <hi>Agonothetes,</hi> was <hi>Victor:</hi> That <hi>Theon</hi> of <hi>Thebes</hi> ſung, and that <hi>Pronomus</hi> of <hi>Thebes</hi> taught, or was the Teacher of the Game. The two other Inſcriptions are mentioned by <hi>Fulvius <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſinus;</hi> but he ſaith not, where they are. <hi>Pitharotus</hi> was <hi>Archon</hi> the ſecond Year of the Hundred twenty ſeventh <hi>Olympiad;</hi> that is to ſay, Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, ſeventy one Years before the Nativity of our Lord, and Four hundred, eighty three Years after the Foundation of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Beginning of the Second Inſcription is like the Firſt: But after telleth, That <hi>Andron,</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Pandion,</hi> was <hi>Victor;</hi> That <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocles,</hi> of <hi>Ambracia,</hi> was Muſician; and That <hi>Lyſippus,</hi> of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> made, or exhibited the Play. <hi>Suidas</hi> and <hi>Athenaeus</hi> mention one <hi>Lyſippus,</hi> as the Author of many <hi>Tragedies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Third ſhews, That <hi>Thraſyllus,</hi> Son of <hi>Thraſyllus</hi> of <hi>Dicelia,</hi> was the Founder of this Building; and being the Contriver of the Game, or Play, and himſelf <hi>Victor,</hi> erected it for the Men of the Tribe of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoon; Ericus</hi> of <hi>Chalcis</hi> being Muſician, <hi>Naeachmus</hi> Archon, and <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domus Sotius</hi> taught the Game. <hi>Naeachmus</hi> was Archon of <hi>Athens</hi> the firſt Year of the Hundred and fifteen <hi>Olympiad;</hi> that is, Four hundred, thirty four Years after the Building of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Three hundred, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years before the Coming of Chriſt:<note place="margin">Helvicus Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nol.</note> So this Inſcription is Forty nine Years older than the two firſt; and this a Place of very great Antiquity, the Inſcriptions being older, than thoſe of <hi>Duillius</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> as Monſieur <hi>Spon</hi> obſerves. <hi>Fulvius <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſinus</hi> hath obſerved, That the Terms uſed in theſe Inſcriptions, anſwer to thoſe that are at the beginning of <hi>Terence.</hi> For, as here we have

ΑΓΩΝΟΘΕΤΗΣ ΘΡΑΣΥΚΛΗΣ ΕΝΙΚΑ, &amp;c. or elſe it will not prove theſe Inſcriptions were erected to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Comedians,</hi> but to <hi>Victors</hi> in the Athletick Games, and this Place to have been dedicated to the Publick Uſe of thoſe Athleticks; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Victory was to be gain'd and loſt by different Parties; as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in theſe Inſcriptions. For in the Third, the Place was built to the Men, appertaining to the Tribe of <hi>Hippothoon,</hi> the Tribe of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Edifice; who was alſo the Inſtitutor of the Game, and Victor in it. In the Firſt and Second nine and forty Years after that, the Lads of the ſame Tribe of <hi>Hippothoon</hi> had the Victory, the People being at the Coſt of the Play, and that under the ſame Archon alſo, thoſe of the Tribe of <hi>Pandion</hi> won the Prize. Here is ſtill you ſee ſome Victory, ſome Prize won or loſt. So that this could not properly belong to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,</hi> or <hi>Tragedies,</hi> wherein no Prize is ſet for them that do beſt, no Victory of any ſides, nor any one really Victor: But, in Athletick Games, uſually the Combatants are ſingle Perſons, or oppoſite Parties; who try for the Maſtery hand to hand, one with another. And that this was really ſo, the word <hi>Agonothetes</hi> puts it out of queſtion. For thoſe Games had ſuch an Officer belonging to them, and always attending upon them, to regulate them, and ſee the Laws of each particular Game duly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that none might ſtrive for Victory, by any undue or diſallowed Means. But whoever heard of ſuch an Officer belonging to the Scene? Therefore my Opinion is, That this was a <hi>Gymnaſium,</hi> or part of one at leaſt, built for the Uſe of the Tribe of <hi>Hippothoon,</hi> by the Munificence of <hi>Thraſyllus;</hi> but that afterwards other Tribes were admitted alſo, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for the Prize; as it is apparent, that thoſe of the Tribe of <hi>Pandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> were, who had the Victory forty Years after. This <hi>Grotto</hi> is a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty large Place within, and hath two Cells, one above another. Above this <hi>Grotto</hi> are two Pillars ſtanding upright, of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Order: but the Leaves are different from the Thiſtle-Leaves of that Order, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long and ſmooth at the Edges.</p>
            <p>After, we turned about the Eaſtern end of the Caſtle, and came to another <hi>Grotto,</hi> made by Nature in the Rock, without either Ornament or Art, uſed to beautifie it: which is more likely to be the <hi>Grotto</hi> of <hi>Pan</hi> and <hi>Apollo,</hi> according to the forementioned Authors, but agrees not with <hi>Pauſanias.</hi> It is ſeen from the <hi>Conſul</hi>'s Houſe, almoſt in the middle of the Town, which lieth North off the Cittadel.</p>
            <p>From this end of the Caſtle,<note place="margin">HADRIAN'S PILLARS.</note> South-Eaſtwards, are thoſe tall and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Pillars, called <hi>Hadrian</hi>'s <hi>Pillars,</hi> and are commonly reputed to be the Remains of his Palace; and were very probably the greateſt Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, if not of the City too, when the whole Structure thereof was entire. But my Comrade and I are not of their Opinion, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his Palace was built on the top of them: for that, doubtleſs, would prove too really a <hi>Caſtle built in the Air:</hi> They being about Fifty two foot high, comprehending the Chapters and <hi>Baſis.</hi> They are of the
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:95495:153"/>
               <hi>Corinthian</hi> Order, chanelled; and of admirable white Marble. They are alſo ſeventeen foot, nine inches about. Their <hi>Baſes</hi> are of two great Stones apiece, whereof the firſt is three foot, nine inches deep; and ſquare eight foot, nine Inches and a half; the next eight foot, four inches and a half, ſquare, and of equal depth with the undermoſt. But ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen of theſe Pillars remain upright; yet by the Plane we found, that there muſt have been ſix Rows of them, and twenty in each Row: which therefore muſt be that <hi>Hundred and Twenty, Pauſanias</hi> ſpeaketh of, as built by the Emperour <hi>Hadrian,</hi> of <hi>Phrygian</hi> Marble, being whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than that of <hi>Pentelycus.</hi> And certainly this was a Work alone, that may ſufficiently juſtifie the Liberality of <hi>Hadcian,</hi> and the great care he took to adorn this City. For this muſt needs have been a wonderful <hi>Portico,</hi> both for Beauty, Uſe, and Grandeur. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſays, That it was incloſed with a Cloyſter, in which were built Rooms of the ſame Stone, only the Roofs of Alabaſter, gilded with Gold, and the whole excellently adorned with Statues and Pictures: That here was the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Library that Emperour collected, and a <hi>Gymnaſium,</hi> bearing his Name, where undoubtedly were celebrated the Games <hi>Adrianalia,</hi> inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by him, and mentioned in ſeveral Monuments there, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly on this at the Church of <hi>Georgopico.</hi> Which ſignifies, That <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Tullius</hi> of <hi>Apamea,</hi> in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> Citizen of <hi>Athens, Corinth, Smyrna;</hi> the only Man among the Athleticks, that ever overcame in all the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Games, viz. <hi>Panellenia, Olympia, Iſthmia, Adriania, Romia</hi> with a matter of one and twenty more, marked upon Urns and Shields; whereof moſt of the Names are defaced. This Man, ſaith the Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, having born away all the Games, Prizes, and other the moſt difficult Exerciſes, died in the two and thirtieth Year, and third Month of his Age, having this Monument erected to him by his Brother, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Tullius Eutyches:</hi> But <hi>Klitoris</hi> gave the Place for it to be erected on.</p>

            <p>About this <hi>Gymnaſium</hi> were an hundred Pillars of <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Marble. It is hard to determine, whether the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Olympius</hi> was here or no; and whether the Plane of this <hi>Portico,</hi> of an hundred and twenty Pillars, was any more than part of it. For the whole place en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironing them, is very large; as appears by the Foundations of the Walls, which are of good Stone, well hewn, and upheld with ſtrong Buttreſſes;
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:95495:154"/>the Plane of theſe Pillars being only an Oblong in the middle of it. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> alſo mentions that Temple, both before, and juſt after this, promiſcuouſly. But, I ſuppoſe, it was in another place; of which more hereafter. I remember, that I took the Dimenſions of the Plane of this Place; but find them not among my Papers. Under thoſe Pillars that yet ſtand, with their Architraves on them, is a little Church, built out of pieces of Pillars, and other Rubbiſh, very badly, without any Chalk or Lime, but rudely laid together; which I ſhould not have mentioned, had not Monſieur <hi>Guiliter</hi> called it the Temple of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Juno Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hellenii;</hi> than which, ſcarce any thing can be more ridiculous. The truth of it is, ſuch a Temple might be ſome where in this Quarter: For <hi>Adrian</hi> built a great way about here, along the River <hi>Iliſſus,</hi> and North-Eaſtward towards Mount S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>George,</hi> or <hi>Ancheſmus,</hi> and called it his Town; as the Inſcription on the Gate of white Marble, between theſe Parts, and the reſt of the City, teſtifie. For towards the City, it is written in <hi>Greek, This is</hi> Athens; <hi>in times paſt the City of</hi> Theſeus: and on that ſide looking toward the Pillars; <hi>But this is</hi> Adrian's, <hi>and not the City of</hi> Theſeus.</p>

For here is the firſt half of it; and ſhews, that it was begun by <hi>Adrian,</hi> in the <hi>New Athens,</hi> and finiſhed by his Son <hi>Antoninus Pius.</hi> I believe this was only the Frontiſpiece of the Repoſitory, or Receiver of the Water. For behinde it is a Place large, and almoſt ſquare, filled up with Dirt and Rubbiſh, and looks as if it had been a Ciſtern, cut out of the Rock: Nor are the <hi>Ionick</hi> Pillars of this Architrave above half way to be ſeen above ground.

Here, like <hi>Virgil,</hi> he might have ſate, and interwoven beautiful Deſcriptions of the Rivers, Mountains, Woods of Olives, and Groves of Lemons and Oranges, with the celebrated Harbours on the Shore, and Iſlands, ſometimes King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, in the <hi>Saronick</hi> Sea, all lying ſpread before him, as on a Map: Which I was contented to do only in Contemplation, and with a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs, to mark out the moſt conſiderable Places on Paper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adrian</hi>'s Pillars are ſeen from this high Rock, South-Weſt,<note place="margin">The STADIUM.</note> and Eaſt of them; but South, South-Weſt, Weſt, from hence, over the River <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſus,</hi> we ſaw the <hi>Stadium,</hi> looking like a ſmall Hill. The way to it from the Town, is by an antient Bridge of three Arches, built croſs the <hi>Iliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> of large hewn Stone, laid firm together without Mortar; and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout forty foot long. On this Bridge was formerly a great Monaſtery, but now forſaken, ſince the <hi>Turks</hi> took <hi>Athens.</hi> The <hi>Stadium</hi> was the Place, where antiently they ran Races, fought wild Beaſts, and celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe other publick Games of <hi>All-Attica,</hi> called <hi>Panathenia.</hi> It was probably here, that they chaſed the <hi>Thouſand Wild Beaſts,</hi> which <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> every Year gave to the People for their Divertiſement. Its Figure and bigneſs continue, although the Degrees be all taken away. It is a long Place, with two parallel ſides, cloſed up circularly at the Eaſt end, and open towards the other end; and is about One hundred, twenty five Geometrical Paces long, and Twenty ſix, or Twenty ſeven broad; which gave it the Name of a <hi>Stadium,</hi> that length being the ordinary meaſure among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> eight of which made a <hi>Roman</hi> Mile. M<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Vernon</hi> meaſuring it exactly, found it to be Six hundred, and thirty <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> feet long: and a juſt <hi>Stadium</hi> is Six hundred, Twenty five foot of <hi>Athenian</hi> Meaſure; which, it ſeems, was but very little bigger than the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but leſſer than the <hi>French</hi> foot. When <hi>Pauſanias</hi> comes to ſpeak of this Place, he tells his Readers, That they would hardly believe what he was about to tell them, it being a Wonder to all thoſe that did ſee it in antient times; and of that bigneſs, that one would judge it a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of white Marble, upon the Banks of the River <hi>Iliſſus.</hi> It was <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes Atticus,</hi> one of the richeſt Citizens <hi>Athens</hi> ever had, that built it; to do which, he conſumed much of the Marble of Mount <hi>Pentelicus:</hi> which now being either all carried away, or buried in the Ruins of the Place, it looks now only like a great and high Bulwark, caſt up in that Form. At the End towards <hi>Iliſſus,</hi> there appears yet ſome Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work; the reſt is now but a <hi>Stadium</hi> of Earth above Ground. This was the ſame <hi>Herodes Atticus,</hi> that built alſo the <hi>Stadium</hi> at <hi>Delphos,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Magnificent Structures, in other Parts of <hi>Greece:</hi> But was not that <hi>Herodes,</hi> that Reigned in <hi>Judaea,</hi> at the time when Chriſt was born; as Monſieur <hi>Spon</hi> hath ſhewed by a ſhort, but juſt Account, out of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities, and Authors, that mention him: which, becauſe it is a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, that every one doth not yet know, I will not omit.</p>
            <q>
               <p>About the Beginning of this Century,<note place="margin">HERODES ATTICUS.</note> two Inſcriptions were found at <hi>Rome;</hi> one of this <hi>Herod,</hi> and the other of his Wife <hi>Regella. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaubon</hi> gives the Explication of the firſt: but as learned as he was, he miſtook notably, in taking this <hi>Herod</hi> for him that Reigned in <hi>Judaea. Arcudius,</hi> with much better ſucceſs, ſhews, That the Inſcription con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd that <hi>Illuſtrious Herod,</hi> the <hi>Athenian.</hi> But becauſe every one
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:95495:156"/>knows not ſo much, I will give you theſe following Particularities of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heredes Atticus</hi> was a Citizen of <hi>Athens,</hi> born at <hi>Marathon,</hi> a little Town pertaining to the Tribe of <hi>Ajax.</hi> He flouriſhed about the time of the Emperours, <hi>Trajan, Adrian, Antoninus,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Aurelius.</hi> His Grand-Father <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> or, as <hi>Suidas</hi> has it, <hi>Plutarchus,</hi> was well to paſs in the World: But having been accuſed of ſome Tyrannical Practices uſed towards the People, the Emperour confiſcated all his Eſtate; ſo that his Son <hi>Atticus,</hi> Father of this <hi>Herod,</hi> lived afterward, at <hi>Athens,</hi> in a mean condition: Until, having found a great hidden Treaſure in his own Houſe, near the Theater, he became on a ſudden very Rich. He was not more fortunate in finding it, than prudent in getting it confirmed on himſelf: For well knowing, ſhould it come to be diſcovered, he ſhould be obliged to give an Account of it to the Emperour; becauſe by the Law, <hi>All found Treaſure belongs to thoſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertign Princes, in whoſe Dominions it is found;</hi> and then he muſt look to become again as poor as ever. He therefore forth-with wrote a Letter in this manner, to the Emperour: <hi>My Liege, I have found a Treaſure in my Houſe; what do you command, that I ſhall do with it?</hi> The Emperour an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, <hi>That he ſhould make uſe of what he had found.</hi> But <hi>Atticus</hi> yet fearing, he might be in danger of ſome trouble, when the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Treaſure ſhould come to be known, wrote the ſecond time to the Emperour; profeſſing ingeniouſly, That the Treaſure he had written to him about, was too great a Poſſeſſion for him, and exceeded the Capacity of a private Man. But the Emperour anſwers him again with the ſame Generoſity: <hi>Abuſe alſo, if thou wilt, the Riches thou haſt ſo ancidentally come by; for they are thine.</hi> By this means <hi>Atticus</hi> became again extream rich and powerful; having married a Wiſe alſo, that was very rich.

               <q>He married a moſt vertuous <hi>Roman</hi> Matron, named <hi>Regilla;</hi> in whoſe Memory he built a cover'd Theater for Muſick, at <hi>Athens;</hi> And after her Death, put his Houſe in Mourning with black Marble of <hi>Lesbos,</hi> to make it an Eternal Monument of his Grief for the loſs of her. He built alſo a Temple at his Country-houſe, called <hi>Triopnaea,</hi> near <hi>Rome;</hi> where thoſe Inſcriptions were found, of which I have ſpoken, and are now to be ſeen in the <hi>Vigne Borgheſe.</hi> He died at threeſcore Years of Age, and left two Sons, of whom Hiſtory is ſilent. He gave order to his Freemen, to bury him at <hi>Marathon,</hi> the Place of his Birth. But the <hi>Athenians</hi> would have his Body with them; and made him be brought thither by ſome of their young Men: burying him in the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium Panathenaeum,</hi> which he had built; accompanying his Body to the Grave weeping, like Children for the loſs of their Parents.</q>

            <p>Advancing a little higher upon the River <hi>Iliſſus,</hi> on the left hand,<note place="margin">The TEMPLE OF THE <hi>ILISSI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AN</hi> MUSES</note> we ſaw the Foundations of a little round Temple, diſcovered not long ſince by an Inundation, which did a great deal of Miſchief to the <hi>Athenians,</hi>
               <pb n="378" facs="tcp:95495:157"/>throwing down their Country-Houſes, Trees, and Walls, and quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying all their Gardens, in its Paſſage. This, probably, was the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Muſae Iliſſiades,</hi> being ſeated upon the Banks of this River, according as <hi>Pauſanias</hi> informs us. From whence <hi>Boreas,</hi> in a Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, took away the Nymph <hi>Orithya,</hi> whom he found ſporting upon theſe Banks. A little further, on the right hand of this River, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſmall Temple, ſince turned into a Church, and conſecrated to the Memory of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Crucifixion,</hi> called <hi>Stauroſis Petrou,</hi> or, as others ſpeak it, <hi>Stauromenou Petrou:</hi> The Floor of which is paved with anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Moſaick Work, and the whole Fabrick of white Marble. This was undoubtedly the antient Temple of <hi>Diana Agrotera,</hi> or <hi>Diana</hi> the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs;</hi> whence the Campagne about it, beyond the <hi>Iliſſus,</hi> was called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra,</hi> from <hi>Diana</hi>'s firſt Hunting there, when ſhe came from <hi>Delos.</hi> And thoſe Parts, towards the Mountain <hi>Hymettùs,</hi> do yet abound with Hares and Partridges. Hard by this, is a little Stream, falling into the <hi>Iliſſus;</hi> which hath its Riſe at a Monaſtery, ſituated on the ſide of the Mountain <hi>Hymettus,</hi> called by the <hi>Greeks, Cyriani,</hi> and by the <hi>Turks, Cosbaſhi,</hi> or <hi>Sheep's Head;</hi> the Fountain of <hi>Iliſſus</hi> being more Eaſtward. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the Water of both of them, is collected into Pipes under ground, and brought to <hi>Athens.</hi> My Opinion is, That this is rather the <hi>Eridanus,</hi> than the other, which waters the other ſide of the Plain of <hi>Athens:</hi> not only becauſe <hi>Strabo</hi> plainly calleth the other <hi>Cephiſus;</hi> but alſo, becauſe ſpeaking of <hi>Eridanus</hi> out of <hi>Callimachus:</hi> 
               <q>There are, as they ſay indeed, ſaith he, thoſe Springs of pure, and potable Water, without thoſe Gates they call <hi>Diochorus,</hi> near that ſide of the City, where the <hi>Lycaeum</hi> is: Not far from which, ſome Body built a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, well furniſhed with good Water; which, if it now remains not, though antiently full of Water, clear, and fit to drink, as being chang'd and corrupted in ſucceeding times, what wonder is it?</q> And even <hi>Pauſanias</hi> himſelf, if rightly underſtood, doth not call that other River, <hi>Eridanus.</hi> That which he ſaith, is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Iliſſus,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and another River of the ſame Name with the</hi> Celtick Eridanus, <hi>which falls into the</hi> Iliſſus, <hi>are the Rivers that glide to the</hi> Athenians: And not, as the Tranſlator of <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſaith, <hi>Amnes in</hi> Atticâ <hi>nobiles,</hi> Cephiſus, <hi>&amp; in eum cadens</hi> Eridanus. Where he hath miſtaken <hi>Attica</hi> for <hi>Athens,</hi> and given thoſe Streams the Title of <hi>Eminence,</hi> without <hi>Pauſanias</hi> his order. That <hi>Eridanus</hi> falls into the River <hi>Iliſſus,</hi> is very properly ſaid of this Stream of <hi>Cyrie Jani;</hi> but not of the other. For the other is a much larger Stream, ſtill well ſupplied with Water, lies much lower than <hi>Iliſſus</hi> or this, and runs in a ſtreight Line, within its own Chanel, although ſometimes divided by Art: And <hi>Iliſſus,</hi> being little more than a Torrent, may properly be ſaid to fall into that on the Weſt ſide of the City; but not that into <hi>Iliſſus.</hi> This only of <hi>Cyriani</hi> can be properly ſaid to fall into the <hi>Iliſſus,</hi> becauſe it riſeth much higher than it. Neither can that other River be ſo properly ſaid to belong to <hi>Athens,</hi> as theſe; it running two or three Miles from it out of Town: But theſe moſt properly, becauſe they ran by the Walls; and from their Springs it is evident, the Town hath ſtill been ſerved with Water, as the Remains of <hi>Hadrian</hi>'s <hi>Aqueduct</hi> and Ciſtern of Waters under <hi>Ancheſmus,</hi>
               <pb n="379" facs="tcp:95495:157"/>and the New <hi>Aqueducts</hi> under ground, to the Town, do manifeſt. If any have better Reaſons for the contrary Opinion, I ſhall be glad to ſee them, and ſubmit to them; but till then, I ſhall ſuppoſe this of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riani</hi> to be <hi>Eridanus;</hi> and ſo call it in my Map.</p>
            <p>Going down the Stream, along the <hi>Iliſſus,</hi> beyond the <hi>Stadium,</hi> and Pillars of <hi>Hadrian,</hi> is another little Marble Building, now dedicated to <hi>Panagia,</hi> or the moſt Holy Virgin; and, as ſome will have it, was antiently the Temple of <hi>Ceres:</hi> and, perhaps, they may have their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons too, of which I am yet ignorant. But <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſeemeth to joyn that to another Temple, at the other ſide of the Town, coming in by the place <hi>Ceramica.</hi> But this Author is not altogether ſo regular in his Deſcriptions of Places, as it might be wiſhed. This Church hath been painted formerly, according to the <hi>Greek</hi> manner, that is, with no great Art: but is now quite defaced.</p>
            <p>Deſcending yet a little further by the River, ſome Rocks ſeem to ſtop its Courſe; whereby the Water begins to appear again, and ſettle in a kind of Pool upon the Rocks. In great Rains, I judge, the Water in the Pools overflows; but while we were there, it was dry Weather, and did not: but finding ſome Subterraneous Paſſage by, or under the Rocks; after a little way, it breaks out again, and makes a Fountain: Which we ſuppoſed to be the <hi>Callirrhoe</hi> of former times, or rather the ſame, which, in <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> is called <hi>Halirrhothium;</hi> becauſe the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of this Place give unto this Fountain a Name, in ſound not much unlike unto it, calling it <hi>Calliro.</hi> But this, I confeſs, I know not how to juſtifie by the Authority of <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> although he ſpeaks of that Fountain three ſeveral times. The <hi>Turks,</hi> after their Mode, have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated two Fountains to this Spring. I take <hi>Calliro,</hi> or <hi>Caliro,</hi> to be only an Abreviation of <hi>Galo Nero,</hi> ſignifying <hi>Good Water:</hi> Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Callirrhoe</hi> to be at another Place; of which I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak, before I conclude this Account of <hi>Athens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hard by this are ſome <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Gardens; and a Summer-houſe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to one of them, inhabiting in the Town. Below them, on the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the River, is another little Temple on the top of a ſmall Rock. But to which of the Gods it was dedicated in times paſt, I ſee nothing to inform me: At preſent it is conſecrated to the Holy Virgin, and they call it <hi>Hagia Maria;</hi> that is, <hi>Saint Maries.</hi> Near to this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the way, that leads to <hi>Capo Colonni.</hi>

               <hi>George,</hi> and hath the minoret of the <hi>Moſque,</hi> or Temple of <hi>Minerva</hi> in the ſame line between, and is not far diſtant from the Caſtle. This was the Hill called in times paſt the <hi>Muſaeum,</hi> from the Poet <hi>Muſaeus,</hi> Diſciple of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> who there uſed to recite his Verſes. My Comrade ſaith, He hath an Inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption that makes this <hi>Muſaeus</hi> the Son of <hi>Eumolpus;</hi> whereas <hi>Suidas</hi> makes <hi>Eumolpus</hi> the Son of <hi>Muſaeus,</hi> and <hi>Muſaeus</hi> the Son of <hi>Antiphemus;</hi> but that there was indeed another <hi>Eumolpus</hi> Grandfather to <hi>Muſaeus;</hi> and Deſcendants often took the Names of their Anceſtors. That Marble tells us alſo, That his Sepulchre was at the Port <hi>Phalera:</hi> But <hi>Paufanias</hi> ſays, He was buried here when he died of great age. The Inhabitants call this Hill <hi>To Seggio;</hi> and ſome <hi>Francks, The Hill of the Arch of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan,</hi> from a Monument of Antiquity upon it: where indeed ſomething is to be read touching that Emperour, but not any thing to juſtifie that naming of the place. It is a Structure of admirable white Marble, and no leſs curious Work, built a proportionable height ſomething circular. In the middle was a large Niche, with a Figure of Marble ſitting in it, and under his Feet in great Letters
ΦΙΛΟΠΑΠΠΟΣ ΕΠΙΦΑΝΟΥΣ ΒΗΣΑΙΕΥΣ,
<hi>Philopappus</hi> Son of <hi>Epiphanes</hi> of <hi>Beſa,</hi> a Town of <hi>Attica.</hi> On the right hand of this is another ſquare Niche with a ſedent Figure within, having theſe Letters under it
ΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΣ ΑΝΤΙΟΧΟΣ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΟΣ ΑΝΤΙΟΧΟΥ,
King <hi>Antiochus</hi> Son of King <hi>Antiochus.</hi> On the left hand we judge was another Statue to make up the Symmetry of the place, but now fallen down. Between the two Statues, upon a kind of Pilaſter, part of the Work, we diſcerned another Inſcription, which
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:95495:158"/>I climbed up to read, whilſt my Companion copied it. It is in Latine, and ſays thus much,
<q>Caius, Julius, Philopappus, Son of Caius of the Tribe of Fabia, Conſul, Frater Arvalis, choſen among the Praetors by the most good and August Emperour, Caeſar, Nerva, Trajanus, who conquered the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans and Dacians.</q>This explains what <hi>Pauſanias</hi> doth but obſcurely mention, ſaying, <hi>In the ſame place the Athenians had raiſed a Monument in Honour of a certain Syrian,</hi> who was without doubt this <hi>Philopappus:</hi> For although he is here nominated of <hi>Beſa,</hi> a Village of <hi>Attica,</hi> yet had his Original from <hi>Syria:</hi> which may be concluded as well from his Name, <hi>Antiochus</hi> common to all the Kings of <hi>Syria,</hi> and out of reſpect to them generally aſſumed by others of that Nation, as alſo by the Statue of <hi>Antiochus</hi> at his right hand, as one of his Illuſtrious Anceſtors, whom the <hi>Athenians</hi> honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and owned for their great Benefactor, as appears by their naming one of their Tribes after his Name
ΑΝΤΙΟΧΙΔΟΣ.

It is ſituate upon the brow of that Rock that hath the Turkiſh Burying place North and North-Eaſt, the Theatre of <hi>Bacchus</hi> and the Caſtle more Eaſt, with a little Valley between. The Foundations are of vaſt Stones, cut in a point like a Diamond, and built in a ſemicircular Form, whoſe Diameter may be about an hundred and forty ordinary paces; but the two <hi>Radii</hi> meet in an obtuſe Angle, on the back part of it, which is entirely hewn out of the Rock.

            <p>Deſcending hence Northward, you paſs over a little Valley and the Turkiſh Burying-place, then mounting again, and leaving the Theatre of <hi>Bacchus</hi> at the Weſt end of the Caſtle on the right hand, you get to the top of a little Steep, though Hill, or rather a ridge of little Hills deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Rock of the Caſtle. Being on the top, I remembred one thing, which my Companion, I find, takes not any notice of. It is a Fountain accommodated according to the Turkiſh mode, with one or two Cocks of water. I have conſidered the ſituation of the place, and do believe it to be a Spring. For I remember when I went firſt up to the Caſtle, I would have taſted of it; but the Conſul told me, the water was not very good to drink, but was uſed by the <hi>Turks</hi> for other ordinary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the Caſtle. I am ſure there are no Aqueducts to bring water ſo high, the <hi>Turks</hi> ſeldom or never uſing ſo much as Leaden Pipes: or if they did, they would not beſtow ſo much coſt to procure themſelves bad water, when they might have good ſo much cheaper from Mount <hi>Hymettus.</hi> My opinion is, That this is <hi>that only Spring</hi> in the Town, that <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſpeaks of, near the <hi>Odeum,</hi> ſaying, There are many Wells in the Town, but only one Spring, which was called <hi>Henneacrene,</hi> becauſe the water iſſued out by nine ſeveral Spouts, and was thus adorned by the Tyrant <hi>Piſiſtratus.</hi> This in another place he mentions only by the name of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or Spring, coming down from the <hi>Acropolis</hi>-wards to the Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Pan,</hi> near the <hi>Propylaea</hi> or outward Gate of the Caſtle. He mentions it a third time to this purpoſe: <q>Going to the Caſtle, ſaith he, by the Theatre of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> is the Monument of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> &amp;c. But the Temple of <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> is worthy to be ſeen for the many Statues and Pictures of him and his Children: in which is a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, near which they ſay <hi>Halirrhothius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Neptune,</hi> lay with <hi>Alcippa,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Mars,</hi> and was therefore ſlain by him: which Murder gave occaſion for the firſt Judgment to be given on Capital crimes.</q> All theſe places evidently mark out the Fountain we ſpeak of. Again, after he had ſpoken of the Temple of <hi>Pan</hi> and <hi>Apollo,</hi> by way of connexion he adds <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which his Tranſlator turns not well, <hi>Quae verò <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbis regia Areopagus dicitur, &amp;c.</hi> For ſo he ſeems to break the thread of <hi>Pauſanias</hi> his Deſcription. <hi>Sylburgius</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore corrected him well, tranſlating it thus, <hi>Secundum hoc eſt ea <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbis pars, quae Areopagus dicitur:</hi> About, by, or near which place is that part of the City called <hi>The Areopagus;</hi> making this good conjecture perhaps, ſaith he, from the nearneſs of it to the Hill of <hi>Mars.</hi> For from this Fountain, as I ſaid, runs the ridge of a Hill from the Caſtle North-Weſtwards; and might well enough be called <hi>Mars his Hill,</hi> on which that Region of the City was built, that bears <hi>Mars</hi> his Name, being
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:95495:160"/>called <hi>Areioſpagus,</hi> or the <hi>Village of Mars. Pauſanias</hi> further adds, That in this place there were two Senates or Councils. The one was the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of the <hi>Five hundred,</hi> to whom belonged the Judgment of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ordinary matters. The other was the Senate of the <hi>Areopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gites</hi> only, where they judged of Capital crimes and caſes extraordinary. Now if the <hi>Areopagus</hi> were upon this ridge of the Hill deſcending from the Caſtle, <hi>Heſychius</hi> is not ſo very blameable for putting it in that <hi>Acro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis;</hi> for this Hill is part of the Rock the Caſtle ſtands upon. And <hi>Suidas</hi> ſaith, That <hi>Pagus</hi> ſignifies a <hi>Rock,</hi> Hill, or other eminent place. All which doth clearly inſinuate, that this ſo celebrated place of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature was built upon this Hill; whence it was called <hi>Mars his Hill,</hi> becauſe upon it, <hi>Mars</hi> had ſuffered Judgment in a ſolemn Aſſembly for the Murder of <hi>Halirrhothius</hi> Son of <hi>Neptune.</hi> I ſhall only add, That if theſe conjectures of mine, touching the <hi>Areopagus</hi> and Fountain there, be good, it will make a great alteration in the Names, which Travellers have hitherto given to ſundry Antiquities in <hi>Athens.</hi> For it followeth, that the Temple of <hi>Ceres</hi> was near that place, and not on the Banks of <hi>Eiliſſus;</hi> and that the Fountain <hi>Caliro</hi> there alſo, was neither <hi>Calirrhoe, Hallirrhothium,</hi> nor <hi>Henn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>acrene:</hi> as indeed it could not be. For that Fountain on the River <hi>Iliſſus</hi> was never within the Walls of the City as thoſe were, no more than the River <hi>Eiliſſus</hi> it ſelf that ran by its Eaſtern Walls. This alſo helps ſomething to vindicate the regularity of <hi>Pauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> his Deſcription of <hi>Athens;</hi> and without which he will be ſaid to have done it with the greateſt confuſion imaginable. I doubt alſo, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors confound this Fountain <hi>Halirrhothium</hi> with <hi>Calirrhoe,</hi> the Fountain of <hi>Calydou</hi> in <hi>Aetotia:</hi> of which I have ſpoken ſomething already in what I have ſaid at <hi>Patras.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this Fountain, keeping along the ridge of the Hill, a little way North-Weſtwards, under a cragged Rock is a ruined Church, they ſay was formerly dedicated to Saint <hi>Dennys</hi> the Areopagite: and by it is the Palace of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Athens.</hi> They believe it was built on the Foundations of the Palace that moſt Illuſtrious Senator lived in, who was the firſt Chriſtian and firſt Biſhop of <hi>Athens.</hi> Of this Church there is nothing to be ſeen now but a heap of ruines; and a Well, where they ſay, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hid himſelf for a little while, ſeeing the people put in an uproar upon his Preaching in the <hi>Areopagus.</hi> This Tradition ſeems to confirm my opinion, that the <hi>Areopagus</hi> ſtood hereabouts.</p>

The Beauty of this Structure is not at all prejudiced by its littleneſs; but ſtill remains a Maſter-piece of Architecture, not eaſie to be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd, much leſs exceeded by any other.

            <p>Within the Quire or Holy place is a piece of a Pillar, made hollow on the top, I ſuppoſe, for a Font to baptize in: on the ſides of which are two large ancient Inſcriptions; one whereof I copied, but not the other, it ſtood ſo in a corner againſt the Wall.</p>

               <hi>Theodorus;</hi> and a little further, another Church, called <hi>Hagia Kyra:</hi> and the way from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Negropont</hi> ſtill continuing yet onwards, without the Town, you paſs by ſeveral other entrances into the City, and ways out into the Country, until you come to a Church they call <hi>Sotira Lycodemou,</hi> on the Eaſt-ſide of the Town, between the Town and Mount S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>George.</hi> Here is ſuppoſed to have been the <hi>Lycaeum:</hi> for <hi>Sotira Lycodemou</hi> is as much as to to ſay, <hi>Our Lady of the Lycaeum;</hi> being on that ſide of the Town, where the antient Place of the <hi>Lycaeum</hi> was ſaid to be; to wit, towards the River <hi>Eiliſſus.</hi> The Church now ſtanding there, is a Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Brick, and other Materials they found about the Place, of no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tienter Date, than the publick Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, if ſo long. There are two great Chairs of Stone, one within the Church, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without: both of very antient Work. On that within are ſome few Figures in <hi>Baſſo-relievo,</hi> and theſe Letters,

<hi>Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus, Son of Diodorus.</hi> I remember <hi>Pliny</hi> ſomewhere ſpeaks of a great Sculptor of this Name; but his chiefeſt Skill was in Silver-work. And this is what I obſerved to remain without the preſent Town.</p>
            <p>But if from the Temple of <hi>Theſeus</hi> you go the neareſt way directly into the Town, North-Eaſtward, you will come to the Frontiſpiece of a very antient Temple, with ſome of the Foundations of the reſt, about it. The Stone looketh of a dark browniſh colour with Age. This my Comrade thinketh to be the Temple of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> God, <hi>Serapis;</hi> whoſe Worſhip was brought to <hi>Athens</hi> by <hi>Ptolomy.</hi> But I rather believe it that antient Temple of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux, Pauſanias</hi> ſpeaks of; above which lay <hi>Pandroſa</hi>'s Grove. The nearneſs to <hi>Theſeus</hi> his Temple, and the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Stone, are my Arguments out of <hi>Pauſanias.</hi> There is room enough for <hi>Pandroſa</hi>'s Grove to have been above it, towards the Caſtle; and the <hi>Prytanaeum</hi> to have been by that; and thence to deſcend into the lower Parts of the City, to the Temple of <hi>Serapis,</hi> and thence to the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Olympius,</hi> according to <hi>Pavias.</hi>

It was of white Marble, and only the Front, looking towards the Weſt, now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains; which conſiſts of four <hi>Dorick</hi> Pillars, bearing up the Eagle on the Architrave, upon which the Inſcription is written. On the higheſt point of the Eagle is a broad Stone laid; on the edge whereof we read, <hi>The People to Lucius Caeſar, Son of the Son of Auguſtus Caeſar, the Son of God:</hi> meaning <hi>Lutius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Germanicus,</hi> who was the Son of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> by Nature, and the Adopted Son of <hi>Julius;</hi> whom they had new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tranſlated amongſt their Gods. And I believe his Statue was ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Stone, on that point of the Temple.

But they had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted the Inſcription, on the Architrave I before mentioned; which ſhews it was built in the time of <hi>Herodes Atticus,</hi> and his Son <hi>Eucles.</hi> The <hi>Prytaneum,</hi> doubtleſs, was not far from hence, but up higher to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Caſtle. And it may poſſibly be, that this Stone was once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited there: For though it be great, yet is not too big to have been brought thither. But where really the <hi>Prytaneum</hi> was, is not yet diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. I am apt to believe, it was between the ſecond Wall, and the North-ſide of the Caſtle. For <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſtill ſpeaks of deſcending from it, to the way called <hi>Tripoda,</hi> from its being adorn'd with Trivets, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to <hi>Apollo;</hi> and alſo of going from thence to the Temple of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapis,</hi> towards the lower Parts of the City.

            <p>But now I am got into <hi>Pauſanias</hi> his Road, I were beſt follow him ſo far as I can. From the Temple of <hi>Serapis,</hi> he paſſeth to the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Olympian,</hi> built by the Emperour <hi>Hadrianus:</hi>
               <note place="margin">JUPITER OLYMPIUS</note> Of this I have ſpoken a little already, when I deſcribed <hi>Hadrian</hi>'s Pillars. But I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined not, where it was.

            <p>The Entrance hath been in the middle of the Front, which regardeth the Weſt, as may be proved from the Remains of it: For on the North-ſide it is joyned to a Wall of the ſame Order, adorned with <hi>Corinthian</hi> Pillars, which are ſet upon <hi>Baſes,</hi> and a proportionable Frize above the Chapiters; which are eighteen in number: beſides two on the North-ſide of the <hi>Veſtibulum,</hi> or Entrance.

And this is the Circumference <hi>Pauſanias</hi> gives to the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Olympius.</hi> Beſides, it is here in the lower Parts of the Town, from the <hi>Prytaneum,</hi> as <hi>Pauſanias</hi> clearly ſeems to inſinuate, which lay on the North-ſide of the Caſtle, as <hi>Thucydides</hi> placeth it. This Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference was not meerly the Temple, as my Comrade ſeemeth to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, by doubling the length to make it, in proportion, like that of <hi>Minerva.</hi> For thus it would be a monſtrous Building, and could no way be accommodated to one ſide, which is a <hi>Stadium</hi> long. For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Front, which is the narroweſt ſide of the Temple of <hi>Minerva,</hi> to which he compares it, to be one <hi>Stadium</hi> broad, the Flanks to it muſt be two <hi>Stadiums;</hi> which, with the Parallel to the Front, makes ſix <hi>Stadiums</hi> about. Suppoſe the Front-ends to be half a <hi>Stadium</hi> apiece,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:95495:164"/>then the two ſides would be two <hi>Stadiums,</hi> againſt the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of one ſide, being a <hi>Stadium;</hi> and the whole would be five <hi>Stadiums:</hi> and this Porch remaining, would be in the Corner. Beſides, what poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is there of making a Roof to a Building of Threeſcore and two Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical Paces, and one half; that is, Three hundred and twelve Feet, and one half broad? So that it is plain, this Building was exactly four ſquare, and that each ſide contained a <hi>Stadium,</hi> which makes four <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia;</hi> as the remaining ſide doth. Nor yet do I believe, that this Wall was the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Temple it ſelf; but only the <hi>Peribolus,</hi> or Court that ſurrounded the Temple. And this is plain from <hi>Pauſanias</hi> alſo, if we follow himſelf, and not his Interpreters, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. Before you enter into the <hi>To Hieron,</hi> or ſacred Place of <hi>Jupiter Olympian, Hadrian</hi> founded the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, with the Image very worthy to be ſeen. What difference there is between <hi>Hieron</hi> and <hi>Naon,</hi> let better Antiquaries judge. But ſure I am, <hi>Pauſanias</hi> here puts it to make a diſtinction between that which <hi>Hadrian</hi> built, of later times com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively ſpeaking, and that very antient <hi>Hieron,</hi> which they generally ſuppoſed <hi>Deucalicon</hi> built preſently after the Deluge, and was ſituate ſomewhere within, beyond the Building or Enlargement, which <hi>Hadria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> added. What <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſays is this: <q>At the Entrance, before you enter the <hi>Hieron,</hi> or ſacred Place of <hi>Jupiter Olympius,</hi> that was built of old, <hi>Hadrian,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, in his time built the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, putting an Image of <hi>Jupiter</hi> therein, very worthy to be ſeen; not for bigneſs and greatneſs. For <hi>Coloſſian</hi> Statues are only at <hi>Rhodes</hi> and <hi>Rome:</hi> The like alſo may be ſeen in other Statues. There are Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues alſo, both of Ivory and Gold, excellently well made for their big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; eſpecially two Statues of the Emperour <hi>Hadrian</hi> himſelf; the one of <hi>Thaſſian,</hi> the other of <hi>Egyptian</hi> Marble. But thoſe are Brazen Statues, that ſtand by the Pillars; which the <hi>Athenians</hi> call the <hi>Colony-Cities;</hi> becauſe many of them were ſent from ſuch Places, as were Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies either of <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Athens.</hi> The whole Court [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>] is four <hi>Stadia</hi> about, and full of ſuch Statues; each City of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, or Alliance, having ſent one, and placed it there, to honour the Emperour. But that of the <hi>Athenians</hi> juſtly excelleth the reſt; who in honour of this their great Friend and Benefactour <hi>Hadrian,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected that ſtately <hi>Coloſſus,</hi> which is behind the Temple, a worthy ſight. More within are the things of old time; as the <hi>Jupiter</hi> of Braſs being, as is ſuppoſed, of <hi>Deucalion</hi>'s Dedication, the Temple of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Rhea,</hi> the Grove, or conſecrated Place called <hi>Olympias:</hi> in which there is a hole of a Cubit's bigneſs, where the Waters of <hi>Deucalion</hi>'s Flood, they ſay, were received, and ſuck't in. Into this hole they put yearly certain wheaten Cakes, mixed with Honey. <hi>Iſocrates</hi> his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is ſaid to ſtand againſt a Pillar here: But that <hi>Deucalion</hi> built the firſt, and moſt antient Temple, or <hi>Hieron,</hi> of <hi>Jupiter Olympius,</hi> all here agree; and that he liv'd and dyed at <hi>Athens,</hi> from his Tomb, which they ſay is there, not far from the preſent Temple.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Much might be ſaid out of all this; but I ſhall content my ſelf to give my Thoughts concerning it, on the Scheme I have deſigned of what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, which in ſhort is thus: Firſt, I ſuppoſe the Porch, over the Street, is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and Weſt to it, the Front of the Temple, which was built
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:95495:165"/>by the Emperour <hi>Hadrian;</hi> wherein was the Image of <hi>Jupiter:</hi> and that the four Walls about it, were the utmoſt Bounds of the <hi>Peribolus,</hi> or Court, and of the whole Temple. That where the Pillars are at the Front, were placed the Statues called the <hi>Colonies:</hi> Within that ſpace was the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Sacred Place,</hi> whether it was a Grove, or Place of Sacrifice, Altar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein was the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the <hi>Vetus Sacrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> the old Temple and Altar, ſuppoſed to be built by <hi>Deucalion.</hi> In what Parts the Pillar of <hi>Iſocrates,</hi> and the Temple of <hi>Saturn</hi> ſtood, is uncertain; but it's likely on ſome hand or other, from the Entrance. We gueſſed, that the Wall of the Front had been plated with Metal, by places that look't as if ſomething had been in that manner faſtened to them, and afterward broken, or pulled off. But upon ſecond Thoughts, I rather believe it was placed where the Statues of the Colonies had been faſtened to the Walls. The Marble of the Pillars is not of that ſort, which was fetch't from <hi>Pentelicus,</hi> as the reſt of the Building and Chapters are; but of a ſtreaked Marble, white, and greeniſh. Now from the Topick of <hi>Hadrian</hi>'s Munificence, <hi>Pauſanias</hi> leapeth to the Temples of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Jund, Panathenians,</hi> and from them to the <hi>Pantheon;</hi> and, at laſt, to the Hundred and twenty Pillars built by <hi>Hadrian;</hi> but without mentioning their Situation. After this he comes to take notice of a Statue made to the <hi>Pythian Apollo,</hi> and of a Temple ſacred to <hi>Apollo,</hi> called <hi>Delphinium,</hi> near to the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Olympius:</hi> But of theſe, after all our Enquiry, we could find no Remains.</p>
            <p>Paſſing through this Temple Eaſtwards, you come into the <hi>Bazar,</hi> or Market place; where on the right hand is a <hi>Moſque,</hi> which, they ſay, was formerly the Cathedral Church: But it was rebuilt by the <hi>Turks</hi> ſince; and is altogether now a new Fabrick. Within the Court of it we ſaw two large <hi>Corinthian</hi> Capitals, and an Altar or Pedeſtal for a Statue, with Fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

To give you an Account of this Place, I will firſt preſent you with the Deſign I took of it, together with its Deſcription; and then my Opinion of it.</p>
            <p>It is a little round Edifice of white Marble, very like a Lanthorn; whoſe Roof is ſuſtained by ſix <hi>Corinthian</hi> Pillars, chanelled, being nine foot, ſix inches, and one half long; and the Capitals one foot, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:95495:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>inches deep; the whole Fabrick within is but five foot, eleven inches, and an half <hi>Diameter,</hi> ſet upon a <hi>Baſis</hi> of four foot high. The ſpace between each Pillar, is made up with Pannels of Marble of one Stone, from the top to the bottom; which ſeems like the Horns of a Lanth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>n. So that it is no wonder, that it was called one. Towards the top of thoſe Pannels, it is carved with Trivets. The Pillars ſuſtain a Frize of one circular Stone, well carved with Figures, which is alſo covered with a <hi>Cuppalo</hi> of one other entire Stone, carved in Scales, and ending in a Stem, formed like a Nozel, or Socket of a Candleſtick, with three Beaks, as it were, to lay the Snuffs of a Lamp upon, and a round Hole hewn deep in it, to hold Oyl, or ſome Combuſtible Matter, to make a Light. The Figures on the Frize are ſome fighting, ſome dancing; ſome doing one thing, and ſome another: amongſt which one is always cloathed in a Lyon's Skin; which made us believe, they were the <hi>Hiſtory and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of Hercules.</hi> We told fourteen Cluſters of them: One more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable than the reſt, is a Man with a Lyon's Skin, going to ſet Fire to a great Pile of Wood: On which is the Figure of a Man ſitting with his Hands tied behind him, and a Serpent, that doubleth it ſelf about him. The Pile ſeemeth to be made upon a kind of high Rock. Upon the upper part of the Frize, is an Inſcription, that no Authors have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, before us.

            <p>Tha is, <hi>Lyſicrates, Son of Lyſithidemus of Cicynna, was the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or Preſident of the Game; That the Lads of the Tribe of Achamas had the Victory; That Theon was Muſician; That Lyſiades of Athens taught, when Euaenetus was Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that this place muſt needs be very antient. For <hi>Euaenetus</hi> was <hi>Archon</hi> the ſecond Year of the hundred and eleventh <hi>Olympiad;</hi> which anſwers to the four hundred and eighteenth Year of <hi>Romes</hi> Foundation, and was three hundred thirty five Years before <hi>Chriſts Incarnation;</hi> that is, two thouſand and thirteen Years ſince. Wherefore my Comrade did well to correct his miſtake, concerning the Antiquity of Chanelled Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; which in his former Relation of <hi>Athens</hi> he had received from the Reverend Father <hi>Babin:</hi> where he ſuppoſes them to be of no antienter date than the <hi>Roman</hi> Empetours. It is yet doubtful what this hath properly been, whether a Monument only erected in honour to thoſe who were <hi>Victors</hi> in thoſe publick Games, or whether ſome Part of a <hi>Gymnaſium,</hi> or whether it might not be a Temple dedicated by the Victors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in theſe Games, to what Deities they thought beſt; and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether it might not be a Temple dedicated to <hi>Hercules;</hi> ſeeing that
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:95495:167"/>upon the Frize one may obſerve ſome of his Heroick Actions well repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. The kindneſs he had for <hi>Theſeus,</hi> King of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and the actions he did upon this Subject, might well deſerve ſuch honour from them. From the <hi>Baſſo-relievo,</hi> on the Frize, my Comrade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves it was a Play of which <hi>Hercules furens</hi> was the Subject, who burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf upon Mount <hi>Aetna:</hi> which I cannot agree to, till I know why the Tribe of <hi>Achamas</hi> had the Victory. It ſeems to be ſituate near that way, which, as <hi>Pauſanias</hi> tells, was called <hi>Tripodas,</hi> from the many Braſs Trivets placed in the Temples along it. There are Trivets carved upon this; and moſt probably it might, in former times, have had one placed in it. But whether it be that Temple he before mention'd in that way, dedicated to <hi>Hercules,</hi> I will not poſitively determine; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Baſſo-relievo</hi> on the Frize, and the Athletick Inſcription ſeem ſtrongly to argue for it. By this a way likewiſe might well lead to that Region they called <hi>The Gardens,</hi> being towards <hi>Lycaeum</hi> and River from the <hi>Acropolis,</hi> and not far diſtant. It is remarkable alſo, that <hi>Demoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> flouriſhed at the ſame time; as it appears by the Inſcription upon it, This was built. For he dyed not till the third Year of the hundred and fourteenth <hi>Olympiad,</hi> as <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> obſerveth; which is ſeventeen Years after the Building of this Monument.

               <p>After I had done this, and taken ſome of the proſpects of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, as the little time I had would permit, I made all the haſte I could down (although very unwillingly ſo ſoon) for fear of being benighted: as Mr. <hi>Vernon</hi> was on the ſame account, and ſhut out of the Town; putting the Conſul to a great deal of care and trouble for his ſafety, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone out alone, a foot, and without a Guide. The firſt time I went forth with my Companion and the Conſul, we, loſing our labour by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Snow that fell, returned down the neareſt way we could, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by three Monaſteries, that lay on that ſide of the Mountain. The firſt in deſcending is called <hi>Hagio-Jani ho Carias.</hi> The ſecond is now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, and they ſay the Italians had formerly a Church there in common with the Greeks, called <hi>Hagios Georgios ho Koutelas.</hi> The third is called <hi>Hagios Kyriani</hi> by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and by the <hi>Turks Cosbaſhi;</hi> becauſe of a <hi>Sheeps Head</hi> engraven on a Marble-Sepulchre, now made uſe of for a Ciſtern to the Fountain ariſing there, whoſe ſtream falls into the <hi>Iliſſos.</hi> The Covent is well enough built for that Country, where they do not ſtrive to excel in ſtately Buildings; but rather to hide themſelves as much as they can in obſcurity from the World. This Mountain is celebrated for the beſt Honey in all <hi>Greece,</hi> of which it makes a great quantity to ſend to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where it is much eſteemed for making <hi>Sorbets.</hi> They uſe therefore to bring all the Honey made hereabouts, to be marked with the Mark of this Monaſtery of <hi>Cosbaſhi,</hi> to make it ſell the better. We eat of it very freely, finding it to be very good; and were not at all incommodated with any Gripings after it. This Mountain was not leſs famous in times paſt for Bees and admirable Honey, the Antients believing that Bees were firſt bred here, and that all other Bees were but Colonies from this Mountain; which if ſo, we aſſured our ſelves, that it muſt be from this part of the Mountain that the Colonies were ſent; both becauſe the Honey here made is the beſt, and that here they never deſtroy the Bees. It is of a good conſiſtence, of a fair gold-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and the ſame quantity ſweetens more water than the like quantity of any other doth; which they ſufficiently experience in making <hi>Sorbet.</hi> They wondred at my Comrade, in that he preferred the white Honey of <hi>France</hi> (as that of <hi>Provence</hi> is) telling him, the white Honey was raw, and not perfectly concocted, either by Nature or the Bees. <hi>Strabo,</hi> I remember, ſaith, The beſt Honey of <hi>Hymettus</hi> was by the Silver Mines: But where they were, is now unknown; unleſs hereabouts, by the ſame reaſon. Now the beſt Argument to prove that Bees had their original from hence, is, That here they never deſtroy or impair the Stock of Bees in taking away their Honey. A thing which I no ſooner knew, but I was inquiſitive to underſtand their Method in Ordering the Bees; which being an Art ſo worthy the Knowledge of the Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:95495:174"/>I ſhall not think it beſide the purpoſe, to relate what I ſaw, and was informed to that effect, by ſuch as had Skill in this Place.</p>

They are ſet the wide end upwards, as you ſee here, (A. B.) The Tops being covered with broad flat Sticks, (as at C. C. C.) are alſo plaiſtered with Clay on the Top; and to ſecure them from the Weather, they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them with a Tuft of Straw, as we do. Along each of thoſe Sticks, the Bees faſten their Combs; ſo that a Combe may be taken out whole, without the leaſt bruiſing, and with the greateſt eaſe imaginable. To increaſe them in Spring time, that is, in <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April,</hi> until the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>May,</hi> they divide them; firſt ſeparating the Sticks, on which the Combs and Bees are faſtened, from one another with a Knife: ſo taking out the firſt Combs and Bees together, on each ſide, they put them into another Basket, in the ſame Order as they were taken out, until they have equally divided them. After this, when they are both again accommodated with Sticks and Plaiſter, they ſet the new Basket in the Place of the old one, and the old one in ſome new Place. And all this they do in the middle of the day, at ſuch time as the greateſt part of the Bees are abroad; who, at their coming home, without much difficulty, by this means divide themſelves equally. This Device hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them from ſwarming, and flying away. In <hi>August</hi> they take out their Honey; which they do in the day-time alſo, while they are abroad; the Bees being thereby, they ſay, diſturbed leaſt. At which time they take out the Combs laden with Honey, as before; that is, beginning at each out-ſide, and ſo taking away, until they have left only ſuch a
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:95495:174"/>quantity of Combs in the middle, as they judge will be ſufficient to maintain the Bees in Winter; ſwee ping thoſe Bees, that are on the Combs they take out, into the Basket again, and again covering it with new Sticks and Plaiſter. All that I doubt concerning the Practice of this here in <hi>England,</hi> is, that perhaps they gather a leſs quantity of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and that, ſhould they take the like quantity of Honey from the Bees here in <hi>England,</hi> they would not leave enough to preſerve them in Winter. But this hinders nor much: For by being leſs covetous, and not taking ſo much Honey from the poor Bees, the great enereaſe and multiplying of them would ſoon equalize, and far exceed the little Profit we make by deſtroying of them. This is done without Smoak; wherefore the Antients call this Honey <gap reason="foreign">

The preſent Abbot is called <hi>Ezekiel Stephaki,</hi> who lives at <hi>Athens,</hi> and is a learned Man for that Country; underſtanding the Antient <hi>Greek</hi> very well, and <hi>Latine</hi> indifferently, with a little <hi>Italian.</hi> He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands <hi>Philoſophy</hi> too, ſo far as to be eſteemed a <hi>Platoniſt;</hi> and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that he is an Abbot, yet he profeſſes not to be a Divine, but a Phyſician.

I eaſily perceiv'd, he was not over-fond of ſome of the <hi>Greekiſh</hi> Superſtitions: But for all that, he ſeems to be both a good Man, and a good Chriſtian; and that whatever they talk of him otherwiſe, are but Trifles, and perhaps unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>At another time we went to ſee the Sea-Coaſts of <hi>Athens,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">II. To the SEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COASTS of ATHENS.</note> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Saronick</hi> Gulph, and to ſurvey the antient Harbours along that Shore. So taking Horſes, we directed our Courſe to the Eaſtern Point of the Bay <hi>Phalara.</hi> In our way, about a couple of miles out of Town, we paſſed through the <hi>Athenian</hi> Vineyards, and came to the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern end of a Marſhy Lake, called by <hi>Xenophon, Phalaraea Palus,</hi> but now <hi>Tripyrga;</hi> becauſe there were, as they ſay, <hi>three Towers</hi> by it: which probably were the ruines of the Town of <hi>Limne.</hi> This Lake ſtretcheth it ſelf in length at leaſt three miles along the Shore, and from the Eaſtern end of it runneth a little Rivulet into the Sea, not far from the Eaſtern Point of the Bay of <hi>Phalara;</hi> where ſtands a little ruined Church, called St. <hi>Nicholo.</hi> The place, I believe, was antiently called <hi>Colias Promontorium.</hi> From this to the Weſtern Point, is about three miles? to which we went, continuing along the ſhore, making a great circumference, till we came where the <hi>Portus Phalareus</hi> was, ſituate at the North-Weſt corner of the bottom of the Bay, and is called now only <hi>Porto.</hi> There remains yet the little Harbour to be ſeen, with part of the Walls that ſecured it: But it is now chok'd up with the Sand, and ſo ſhallow, that only ſmall Boats lye there. Neither doth the Bay af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford any ſecure Harbour, as lying open to the South Eaſterly and Weſterly Winds; and Ships that drop Anchor there, are forced to keep a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Still coaſting Weſtwards a mile or two, we came to another Harbour, called in times paſt <hi>Munichia;</hi> which was then, though but ſmall, yet a very good and ſecure Harbour; but is now quite chok'd up, and uſeleſs. A little from the ſhore there are ſeen ruines of Vaults, pieces of Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and hewn Stones under water; and on the ſhore, hard by, are many more, beſides Caves digg'd in the Rocks, Vaults, Walls, broken Pillars, and the foundations of a Temple, which we gueſſed to be that of <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Munichia.</hi> Thence to the raines of <hi>Pitaea</hi> is but a little way, I do not believe much above a quarter of a Mile, going in a ſtreight Line: But going by the Sea-Coaſts, by reaſon of the crookedneſs of the Shore, it may be ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Portus Piraeus</hi> is called at preſent by the <hi>Greeks Porte-Dracone,</hi> and by the <hi>Franks Porto-Lione,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">PORTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIONE.</note> by reaſon of a Lion of Marble, of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable work, placed at the bottom of the Bay, in a poſture of ſitting, but erected upon his fore-feet. It is ten foot high, and by a hole pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced through it, anſwering to its mouth, appears to have been a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. There is ſuch another in the way from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Eleuſis,</hi> in a
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:95495:177"/>couchant poſture. Our French <hi>old and new Athens</hi> told us of a third in the Caſtle, which we could have no account of, unleſs he took the fore part of an Horſe, placed on the top of the Northern Wall, for a Lion. By occaſion of this, my Comrade telleth a ſtrange Story, <hi>viz.</hi> Of a Monſter, ſuppoſed to have been cauſed by an impreſſion made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Phantaſie of the Woman that bare it, by a ſudden view of it. I do not remember that I was preſent at the relation, yet becauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem the thing a matter of more than ordinary curioſity, I ſhall not paſs it by. It happened in the month of <hi>October,</hi> in the Year of our Lord 1665. that a Turkiſh Woman was Delivered of it, in the Citadel, after ſhe had gone with it nine months, as of a Child. So ſoon as it was brought into the world it leap'd down on the ground, began to go, and make a hideous noiſe, reſembling ſomewhat the barking of a Dog. It had Ears ſtanding upright like a Hares, and his Chaps like a Lion; its Eyes ſparkled, and had two great Teeth ſticking out of its Mouth; its Feet like a Child, but the Fingers of its Hands rather reſembled the Claws of Birds of prey; and its Sex ſcarce diſcernable. The <hi>Veivode</hi> and <hi>Caddi,</hi> hearing of it, came to make their Inſpection three days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter its Birth, and preſently gave Sentence of Death againſt it; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding they ſhould dig a great hole in the ground, and throw the Monſter into it; and after that fill up the place again with Stones: which was done upon the Eight of <hi>October.</hi> A French Chirurgion, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Monſieur <hi>Fanchon,</hi> who lived then at <hi>Athens,</hi> deſired to have the Body, that he might Embalm it, and ſend it into <hi>France:</hi> But it was denyed him; the Turks affirming, <hi>That it was a Devil;</hi> and that the memory of it ought to periſh with it; inſomuch that he was forbidden to come near the <hi>place</hi> where it was buried.</p>
               <p>The mouth of <hi>Porto-Lione</hi> is ſo narrow that two Gallies can hardly enter in a-breaſt; having a little Rock, that appears like a heap of Stones, above water, juſt in the entrance: But within, it enlargeth it ſelf into a conſiderable Harbour, with depth enough, and good Anchorage all over; except a little Bay at the utmoſt point of it: which ſeems to have been formerly a ſmall Harbour for Barques; though now choaked up. But that which I judge moſt conſiderable is, that the nature of the place is ſuch, that though a Ship ſhould happen to be driven upon the ſhore, yet it may get off again without damage. Which was tried not long ſince by five Engliſh Ships, who riding there by force of a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Storm, had all their Cables broken in one night; and though they were driven to the ſhore, received no harm at all beſides. The Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents tell, That it was capable of receiving four hundred Veſſels: But by our beſt obſervation, we could ſcarce judge it capable of holding more than forty, or fifty of the great Ships of our times. Along the Shore, on the Eaſt-ſide of it, one may perceive ſome Foundations of Walls, and Ruins: And near to the ſtreet, at the mouth, the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of two ſquare Towers, over againſt each other. Near to the firſt was the Tomb of <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> that made the <hi>Athenian</hi> Port. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were that great Stone Sepulcher we ſaw a little further of, near to ſome Caves cut out of the Rock, we could not determine. Near the mouth of the Port, we were ſhewed a Well, among the Rocks, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining very good freſh water, notwithſtanding it is not above ten yards
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:95495:178"/>from the Sea. The Town that was here in former times, is now utterly ruined, and deſerted, with all the admirable <hi>Portico</hi>'s, and Edifices, <hi>Pauſanias</hi> deſcribeth. The only Building that now remaineth is a kind of Ware-houſe, to receive Merchandiſes, to gather the Cuſtoms and Taxes; and where the <hi>Veivode,</hi> for the moſt part, layeth up his <hi>Velania,</hi> to ſell to the Merchants.</p>

It was deſtroyed by <hi>Syllae;</hi> but the Foundations thereof are yet ſeen in many places, lying in a ſtreight line, as we obſerved returning again to the Town: which we did, moſt part of the way, through woods of Olive-Trees and Vineyards. Now, no more the ſtreet of <hi>Piraea</hi> as in <hi>Pauſanius</hi> his time. About mid-way the Conſul ſhewed us a Well, which Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Guilitier</hi> takes to be the Fountain, near unto which <hi>Socrates</hi> had a Temple dedicated unto him.

                  </gap>, where they dig a reddiſh and fat Earth, which they make Tiles and Pots of; and is, in all likelyhood, the place where the ancient Town <hi>Keramaea</hi> once ſtood: taking from the Potters trade both its old name and new. Near unto this Town was the famous <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demia,</hi> from which all other places, celebrated for the liberal Sciences and Learning, have borrowed the name of <hi>Academy.</hi> Nevertheleſs, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous as it hath been, and is ſtill in great renown, yet is the memory of it here utterly raſed out, and its ſituation ſo obſcurely marked and ſet out by ancient Writers, that it hath been almoſt an inſuperable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to determine where it was. Some have placed it in the way to <hi>Capo Colouni,</hi> from <hi>Suidas</hi> his calling it <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>an high place:</hi> there being none ſuch in this way, but only in that. Wherefore I was much of that opinion alſo: But my Comrade ſhewed me my error; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that <hi>Suidas</hi> might have ſome other reaſon for his calling it a <hi>high place,</hi> than that which I thought of: And it ſeems very probable to have been only from the Tower that was there, from which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan their Races, they ran with lighted Torches in the <hi>Panathenian</hi> Games. Moreover it is plain by that paſſage in <hi>Cicero,</hi> that <hi>Ceramica,</hi> was but ſix <hi>Stadia</hi> from the gate <hi>Dipylon;</hi> called in times more ancient, <hi>Porta Thriaſia,</hi> becauſe it led to the Town <hi>Thria,</hi> which was moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards <hi>Eleuſis,</hi>

But there is now nothing remaining of it, ſave only a ſmall Church, hard by, which ſeems to be built out of more ancient ruins; among
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:95495:178"/>which are ſome Inſcriptions: and they call the place about it <hi>Palaeo-Chori,</hi> that is, <hi>Old-Towm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having paſſed through the Olive-yards, about a mile further, we left an old Tower, a little way to the left hand. My Companion ſtepp'd to it, and finding ſeveral Inſcriptions upon Sepulchral Pillars, he copied them: and ſo we came at laſt to the end of the plain, to the Sea-ſhore; where Mount <hi>Corydalis,</hi> running with its Weſtern point a little into the Sea, makes the Promontory <hi>Amphialia,</hi> about ſix or ſeven miles from <hi>Athens.</hi> Between this Promontory and <hi>Salamina</hi> is a Streight, which is not a mile over in the narroweſt part, where we paſſed it over by a Ferry, attending there for Paſſengers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salamis</hi> is now called <hi>Colouri;</hi> and, as our <hi>Conſul</hi> eſteems it, is about fifty Miles in compaſs. It hath a Harbour on the Weſt-ſide, eight Miles in length, and three Miles broad in the largeſt ſpace. It is of an <hi>Ovael</hi> Figure; and, at the bottom of its Bay, hath a Town of the ſame name with the preſent name of the Iſland, <hi>viz. Colouri.</hi> This Town, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, conſiſts of about an hundred and fifty poor Cottages, and perhaps of four hundred Perſons. There are two other Villages in the Iſland; the one ſituate upon a Hill, on the South-ſide of the Harbour, about five or ſix Miles off, and in ſight of <hi>Colouri;</hi> and is called <hi>Metropis.</hi> The other called <hi>Ambelachi,</hi> is ſituated near the Streight towards <hi>Athens:</hi> They conſiſt of about thirty Houſes apiece. The antient City <hi>Salamis</hi> was, by this laſt, remov'd a little more to the Sea-ſide; where it had a little Harbour: in which, at this day, appear many antient Foundations under Water, of carved Stone; and, according to the appearance of Ruins all thereabouts, the City ought to have been near four Miles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. Near the Ruins of an antient Temple, we found theſe Lines on a black Marble Stone, which hath the antient name

               <p>About <hi>Salamis</hi> we obſerved ſeveral other little Iſlands;<note place="margin">LIPSOCATA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA.</note> as between the <hi>Streight,</hi> and <hi>Porto-Lione,</hi> a deſart one, called now <hi>Lipſocatalia;</hi> but by <hi>Strâbo, Pſytalia.</hi> Beyond the <hi>Streight,</hi> towards <hi>Eleuſis,</hi> are two other little Rocks, or Iſlands cloſe together; the one called <hi>Megala Kira,</hi> and the other <hi>Micra Kira:</hi> On one of theſe it was, called antiently alſo <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> that <hi>Xerxes</hi> built a Silver Throne, to ſit and ſee the Battle fought between his and the <hi>Grecian</hi> Fleet; the Iſſue whereof was, That the <hi>Greeks</hi> handled his great and numerous Navy ſo, that in the end he hardly eſcaped himſelf in a ſmall Boat. We contented our ſelves with the ſight of the reſt of the Iſlands in the <hi>Saronick</hi> Gulph, by viewing them from the <hi>Attick</hi> Shore. But our good Friend, the <hi>Conſul,</hi> who had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten viſited them, gave us alſo a more particular Account of them; by the help of which, and our own Obſervation, we are enabled to give a more exact Account of it, than any hath been yet publiſhed: which I think very proper to inſert in this Place; becauſe the whole <hi>Saronick</hi> Gulph is ſo frequently mentioned in antient Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>This Gulph is contained within the Promontory <hi>Sunium,</hi> now called <hi>Capo Colonni,</hi> on the <hi>Attick</hi> Shore, and <hi>Schillaeum,</hi> now <hi>Capo Skillo,</hi> on the <hi>Morean,</hi> of <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> Shore; which I ſuppoſe to be about two

There are many little Iſlands in this Gulph; but the principal are <hi>Aegina, Colouri,</hi> and <hi>Porus:</hi> and theſe only are inhabited. They had in times paſt a <hi>Veivode,</hi> and <hi>Caddi</hi> common to them all: But of late they have thought good to make an Agreement with the Captain <hi>Baſha,</hi> and to pay him yearly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hundred eighty five Dollers for all their Duties: By which means they are left to themſelves; and might grow Rich again, did not the <hi>Corſairs</hi> haunt them ſo much. For they have Ground enough to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate for ſo few Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aegina</hi> is now the chief Iſland,<note place="margin">AEGINA.</note> and giveth Name at preſent to the whole Gulph, as the River <hi>Saron</hi> did in times paſt.

From Mount <hi>Hymettus</hi> South-Weſt by Weſt; and from <hi>Colouri,</hi> or <hi>Salamis,</hi> it lieth almoſt South. It is counted eighteen Miles from the neareſt Shore of <hi>Attica,</hi> and twenty five from <hi>Porto-Lione,</hi> and about a dozen from the <hi>Morea;</hi> being about thirty Miles alſo in Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. It hath no Harbour for Ships about it: But towards the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi> Shore, between the little Iſlands <hi>Angoſtri, Douroniſt, Moni,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ANGESTRI.</note> and it ſelf, the <hi>Venetian</hi> Armada often dropped Anchor, during the War of <hi>Candia.</hi> It hath no City, or Village now in it, ſave only that which is called by the ſame Name, with the Iſland <hi>Aegina:</hi> which, in the Year One thouſand, ſix hundred, fifty four, was almoſt ruined by the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians;</hi> who came hither with their Ships, and, as they ſay, took away no fewer than ſix hundred poor Chriſtian <hi>Greeks,</hi> and put them to row in their Gallies. The Town conſiſts of about eight hundred dwelling Houſes, but now almoſt ruined. The Caſtle lieth above it, and is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for little, but the fair Proſpects it affords into all Parts round about it. For from hence many of the Iſlands of the <hi>Archipelago</hi> are diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the whole <hi>Attick</hi> and <hi>Morean</hi> Shore. In this Caſtle are ſix Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns, and about fourſcore Houſes; two Churches, joyn'd near toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; one for the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the other for the <hi>Latines:</hi> in which laſt remains a fine Sepulcher of Marble, made for a <hi>Venetian Proveditor;</hi> being a Mark of the Dominion they had over it. The Remains of its Antiquity, are the Ruins of two Temples: The one, ſituate North-Weſt of the Town, ought to be that of <hi>Venus,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Pauſanias.</hi> It hath but two Pillars now ſtanding, and a piece of an Architrave on them, with ſome Rubbiſh below. The other is on the other ſide of the Iſle towards <hi>Athens,</hi> four Miles from the Town, in a Wood, upon a Hill. This is thought to be that Temple, which <hi>Aeacus,</hi> the firſt King of the Iſland, dedicated to <hi>Jupiter.</hi> It hath yet twenty one Pillars ſtanding, with their Architraves on them, and many others lying on the Ground. They are of the <hi>Dorick</hi> Order, chanelled, twenty two foot and an half long; the Architrave thirteen foot and an half long, and about three broad. By the Order of placing them, there ought to have been fifty in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſtanding at a pace and an half diſtance from each other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aegina</hi> hath great Plenty of Corn, Cotton, Honey, and Wax; alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:95495:180"/>bundance of Almonds, and <hi>Keratia,</hi> or Carobs. It abounds ſo with a ſort of red-legg'd Partridges, that by order of the <hi>Epitropi,</hi> or the chief Magiſtrates of the Town, all, both Young and Old, Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, go out yearly, as the Pigmies of old did againſt the Granes, to war with them, and to break their Eggs before they be hatch'd; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, by their Multitudes, they would ſo deſtroy, and eat up the Corn, that they would inevitably bring a Famine every year upon the Place. But they ſay, There are no Hares at all in this Iſland.</p>

                  <hi>Porus</hi> is ſituated near the Shore of the <hi>Morea,</hi>

               <p>The Situation of the reſt of the Iſlands is as followeth, beginning at <hi>Promontorium Sunium,</hi> or <hi>Capo Colonni;</hi> and ſo coaſting along the <hi>Attick</hi> Shore, Weſtwards.</p>
               <p>The firſt is a little Deſart Iſland,<note place="margin">PATROCLEA now GUIDRONI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SA.</note> called now <hi>Guidroniſa,</hi> or <hi>The Iſle of Aſſes,</hi> hard by <hi>Capo Colonni,</hi> South-Weſtwards. It was heretofore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Patroclea,</hi> and is ſtill by ſome.

But the Wood thereof is now much ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the <hi>Corſairs.</hi> I would have gone to ſearch further concerning it, when I was at <hi>Capo Colonni;</hi> but I could get no Barque to go over.</p>
               <p>Further is an Iſland, called now, if my Book be right marked, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noni.</hi> I believe, it may be that, which was called, in times paſt, <hi>Belbina.</hi> And yet, a good way further, near <hi>Lambra,</hi> formerly <hi>Lampra,</hi> there is a Bay; which I judge to have been, in antient times, <hi>Hyphormius Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and the Promontory that makes it, <hi>Aſtipalia:</hi> where there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther little Iſland, called <hi>Eliſſo;</hi> which probably may be that <hi>Strabo</hi> names <hi>Eleuſſa.</hi> Four or five Miles further, near to a Promontory, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends from Mount <hi>Hymettus</hi> into the Sea, called antiently <hi>Zoſter,</hi> there are five little Iſlands together, <hi>Comboniſſa,</hi> the <hi>Buttons,</hi> and, as the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal's Druggerman</hi> noted them to me, <hi>Halicas</hi> or <hi>Selicas,</hi> the <hi>Salt</hi>-Pits; but I ſuppoſe this Name belongs rather to the Promontory, with a ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Church upon it, bearing the Name of <hi>Hagio Coſmo.</hi> There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther little Iſland called <hi>La Flega,</hi> I believe the ſame that <hi>Strabo</hi> calls <hi>Phaura.</hi>

The reaſon is, For that the <hi>Turks</hi> will not venture thither to hunt, fearing the Pyrates that infeſt thoſe Seas; and the <hi>Greeks,</hi> poor Chriſtians! have not leiſure, from the labour of getting their living, to attend to ſuch ſports.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Colouri</hi> follows, between which and the Shore of the Plain of <hi>Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> are the two little Rocks, mentioned before, almoſt joined together, called <hi>Megala Kira</hi> and <hi>Micra Kira.</hi> Turning along the Shore of <hi>Megara</hi> and <hi>Colouri,</hi> at the entrance of the Harbour of <hi>Colouri,</hi> are two other

And he did indeed ſo accommodate himſelf to our curioſity, that we had all the reaſon in the World to be well ſatisfied with him, who ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us ſo well, Our Conſul alſo was ſo kind to us as to lend us his Druggerman, armed with his <hi>Barrat,</hi> or Licence, from the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> to ſecure us againſt <hi>Examinations,</hi> and other hazards we might meet with from the <hi>Turks,</hi> and was ſo civil as to accompany us himſelf as far as <hi>Eleuſis.</hi>

               <p>Thus on <hi>Shrove Tueſday</hi> in the Morning, being the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> 1675/6, directing our courſe North-Weſtwards from <hi>Athens,</hi> we paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the Olive-yards, leaving the way to <hi>Colouri</hi> on the left hand. In an hour and halfs riding over the Plain of <hi>Athens,</hi> we began to aſcend the Hill now called <hi>Daphne,</hi> from the abundance of <hi>Oleanders</hi> that grow there, they call <hi>Picra-Daphne,</hi> or <hi>Bitter Laurel.</hi> This Hill begins in the way from <hi>Thebes</hi> to <hi>Athens,</hi> and ends at the Promontory, that makes the Streight between <hi>Salamis</hi> and it. It is divided by this way into two high Points, whereof that towards the Sea was undoubtedly that which <hi>Strabo</hi> calls <hi>Coridalis mons;</hi> the other, <hi>Thucydides</hi> calls <hi>Aegalis.</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting between theſe two tops of the Hill, in half an hour we came to an
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:95495:181"/>antient Convent of <hi>Caloyers,</hi> ſeated between the Ridges on it, called alſo <hi>Daphne.</hi> It is about half way to <hi>Eleuſis;</hi> and founded, as they ſay, by the fair penitent <hi>Magelone.</hi> 'Tis fenced with high Walls about it; but for all that, it is ſo infeſted by the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Corſairs,</hi> that there is ſeldom found above one or two <hi>Caloyers</hi> in it; the reſt being retired commonly to an Hermitage up higher, among the Rocks of the Mountain. For it is a great Road that way to the <hi>Morea,</hi> and conſequently haunted by the unruly <hi>Turks</hi> paſſing that way; and the <hi>Corſairs</hi> often viſit it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is within half an hours riding to the Sea-ſide. The Church here is dedicated to the moſt holy Virgin, and hath been a Fabrick, very beautiful, having a large <hi>Cuppalo</hi> in the middle of it, encruſted within with antient <hi>Moſaick</hi> Work; of which the Picture of our Saviour is yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining. Without the Gate is a Well of very good freſh Water; from whence we deſcended between the two Ridges of the Hill; and in leſs than half an hour came to the Sea-ſide. Whence, winding about the Bay, which from <hi>Porto-Lione,</hi> and the Streight of <hi>Salamis</hi> runneth in Northwards, we came to a little Lake of Salt, and Bituminous Water; running out into the Sea by a little Stream, called by <hi>Pauſanias, Scirus.</hi> The Lake ſeems to be the <hi>Rhaeti alvei,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Pauſanias</hi> to be the antient Bounds between the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Eleuſinians;</hi> not between <hi>Attica</hi> and <hi>Eleuſis,</hi> as either the Interpreter, or Printer of <hi>Pauſanias</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes. There is a Hill alſo North of it, which had a Town on it, and both called <hi>Scirus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A little further we came to the River <hi>Cephiſus,</hi> which then was but a little Stream; but after Rains, and melting of the Snow from the Mountains, it ſwells ſo big, that it overflows a good part of the Plains. It comes down from the Mountain <hi>Parnes</hi>-ward, and from thoſe towards the <hi>Eleutherians,</hi> and Mount <hi>Cithaeron.</hi> It is now called only <hi>Palaeo-milo,</hi> from an old Mill, that ſtood there in times paſt: But now nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of it, ſave only the Pool that poured in the Water. But higher it hath yet ſome Mills under the Mountain <hi>Daphne;</hi> along the foot whereof it keeps its Courſe. This is that <hi>Cephiſus, Pauſanias</hi> mentions; which muſt not be any ways confounded with that, <hi>Strabo</hi> ſpeaks of; which runneth Weſt of the City of <hi>Athens;</hi> which ſome, by miſtake, call <hi>Eridanus:</hi> of which, elſewhere. There is another <hi>Cephiſus</hi> in <hi>Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otia,</hi> that empties it ſelf into the Lake <hi>Copais;</hi> and at <hi>Sycion</hi> another, that falls into the Gulph of <hi>Gorinth,</hi> now called the Gulph of <hi>Lepanto.</hi> On this ſide of the <hi>Eleuſinian Cephiſus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pauſ. <hi>in</hi> Attic.</note> as <hi>Pauſanias</hi> well diſtinguiſheth it from the other, was the Sepulcher of <hi>Theodorus,</hi> a famous <hi>Tragedian;</hi> and on the Banks of it were the Statutes of <hi>Mneſitheus,</hi> and his Son, who conſecrated the Hair of his Head to the River <hi>Cephiſus;</hi> being the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the <hi>Greeks</hi> in thoſe days, to make that Offering to the Rivers, they eſteemed their Gods.</p>
               <p>Having paſſed the Stream, we continued our way over a ſpacious Plain, along a Cauſway, paved with large Stones, which then was beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with Anemonies of all ſorts of Colours, mixed and ſhaded between White and Scarlet, and between a deep Blue and White. This was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Via Sacra</hi> in antient times, from the great Proceſſions made by the <hi>Athenians</hi> unto the ſacred Myſteries of <hi>Ceres</hi> at <hi>Eleuſis.</hi> We obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved many Ruins, as we went along it, of Churches or Temples; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:95495:181"/>one, about ſome two Miles beyond the River; which we judg'd to be that of the <hi>Cyamites,</hi> ſo called, as <hi>Pauſanias</hi> thinketh, from ſome <hi>Hero</hi> of that Name, who firſt taught them to ſow Beans there: For <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>About a Mile further we ſaw the Ruins of another Temple, of which one Panel of Wall was only ſtanding, of a greyiſh-colour'd Sone; which we therefore judg'd might be ſome Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> which <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſaith, was of ordinary Stone.</p>
               <p>Juſt at the Ruins of <hi>Eleuſis,</hi> is a little Church, dedicated to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>George;</hi> which hath ſtanding about it ſome beautiful Pillars, chanelled, and of the <hi>Ionick</hi> Order, as I knew by their Chapters, which lay not far off from thence. Before it are two great round Stones, either for the <hi>Baſis</hi> to Pillars, or Pedeſtals for Statues, with Inſcriptions on each of them; but much defaced. This, without doubt, was the Temple of <hi>Diana Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pylaea;</hi> ſo called, becauſe her Temple was ſituate without the Gates of the City <hi>Eleuſis.</hi> One of theſe Inſcriptions ſpeaks of one <hi>Nicoſtrata,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Meneo..</hi>... of the Town <hi>Berenicida,</hi> initiated into the Myſteries of <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Proſerpina:</hi> For I take <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Thus, in about four Hours time from <hi>Athens,</hi> we arrived at <hi>Eleuſis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ELEUSIS.</note> now called <hi>Lepſina,</hi> or <hi>Lephſina. Eleuſis</hi> was heretofore a City of great Antiquity; and in thoſe early times, vied with the <hi>Athenians</hi> for Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, until it was reduced by <hi>Theſeus.</hi> In the moſt flouriſhing times of <hi>Athens,</hi> it was one of their principal Towns; but is now cruſhed down under their hard Fortune; having been ſo ill treated by the Chriſtian Pirats, more inhuman than the very <hi>Turks,</hi> that all its Inhabitants have left it; there being now nothing remaining, but Ruins. The Place is ſituated upon a long Hill, ſtretched out near to the Sea, South-Eaſt and North-Weſt, not far diſtant from the foot of the Mountain <hi>Gerata.</hi> The whole Hill ſeems to have been built upon; but chiefly towards the Sea: Where the firſt thing we came unto,<note place="margin">TEMPLE OF CERES.</note> was the ſtately Temple of <hi>Ceres,</hi> now laid proſtrate on the Ground: I cannot ſay, not having one Stone upon another; for it lieth all in a confuſed heap together: the beautiful Pillars buried in the Rubbiſh of its dejected Roof and Walls; and its goodly carved and poliſhed Corniſhes, uſed with no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, than the worſt Stone of the Pavement. It lies in ſuch a rude and diſorderly manner, that it is not poſſible to judge of its antient Form; only it appear'd to have been built of moſt beautiful white Marble, and no leſs admirable Work. Some Chapters we ſaw of the <hi>Ionick</hi> Order, being three foot, nine inches and an half <hi>Diameter;</hi> which belonged to Pillars of two foot, and eleven inches <hi>Diameter.</hi> I took the Dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:95495:182"/>of a very beautiful Corner-Stone likewiſe; being ſix foot, five inches ſquare, two foot, one inch, and a quarter thick. We obſerved many other large Stones among them, carved with Wheat-ears, and bundles of Poppy, bound together, being the Characters of <hi>Ceres.</hi>

I quickly call'd to my Companion, and told him we were beſet by the <hi>Corſairs,</hi> or Rogues. He thought I jeſted; but I aſſured him, I ſaw <hi>Mouratis</hi> lie kill'd, as I thought. Where the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul</hi>
                  <pb n="430" facs="tcp:95495:184"/>was I could not tell; but we haſted to his Reſcue, either to ſave him, or loſe our Lives with him. So with all the expedition the Rocks and Ruins would give us leave, we ran to the Place; where we found the <hi>Conſul</hi> rubbing <hi>Mouratis,</hi> to bring him to Life again: of whom, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we had ſhaken off our ſurprize, we underſtood the matter to be no more than being employed about providing us ſome Meat, they ſtarted a Hare juſt by them; which, as ſoon as they ſaw, our Guide took my Fowling-piece, and <hi>Mouratis</hi> a ſhort Carbine, with a large Bore, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with four Bullets, and ſhot at her. But the Carbine having been charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome days before, and perhaps with a greater quantity of Powder than was fit, in the Diſcharge, the Piece recoiled ſo, that it felled him down backward, and ſtruck all the Breath out of his Body. When he came to himſelf, it was a good while before we could learn of him what was the matter; and then he could hardly be perſwaded, but that he had broken ſome of his Ribs. But <hi>Jani,</hi> who had in vain run after the Hare, returning, gave us a more particular Account of the Accident, and made us content, that the poor Hare had eſcaped us, as well as we the danger we feared. It happened at the ſame time, ſome <hi>Athenians</hi> coming that way from <hi>Corinth,</hi> hearing the Guns go off, and ſeeing three or four Men of us traverſing thoſe Ruins, were frighted as much as we; and concluding us to be <hi>Corſairs,</hi> lying there in ambuſh, to rob and do Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, ran away as hard as they could drive, and hid themſelves in the Woods not far off: Where, having ſtaid a pretty while, and beginning to doubt, whether they might not be miſtaken, and their Fear ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſent out a little Boy as their Scout, to diſcover what we were; who coming nearer to us, happened to know ſome of us: Upon which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, and ſhewed his Company their miſtake. So having comforted <hi>Mouratis,</hi> as well as we could, cauſing him to drink a large draught of Wine; after Dinner we ſet forward again on our Journey, being very glad that we came off ſo well; and bleſſing God, that this once he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered us <hi>to fear, where no fear was.</hi> Our way lying along under the North-ſide of the Hill, where <hi>Eleuſis</hi> ſtood, as we went we obſerv'd the Ruins of an <hi>Aqueduct,</hi> that came in a ſtreight Line from the Mountains North of <hi>Eleuſis;</hi> and amongſt an heap of Rubbiſh, the Trunk of a Statue, without either Hands or Feet; which having removed, we found to be of a Sheep, dedicated to <hi>Ceres</hi> by the <hi>Megarians</hi> in antient times. The whole way was then covered with Anemonies of ſeveral Colours, and wonderfully beautiful. After a Miles riding, we turned about the Corner of the Hill to the left hand; and between that, and the Foot of the Mountain, we came to a Spring, which we believed was the Place, where <hi>Ceres</hi> ſate her ſelf down, when ſhe arrived at <hi>Eleuſis,</hi> weary with the fruitleſs ſearch after her Daughter <hi>Proſerpina.</hi> They called it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; that is, <hi>Floridus.</hi> It hath but a ſmall Stream running from it; and I queſtion, whether it be not loſt, before it comes into the Sea, in its Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through the Valley, between <hi>Eleuſis,</hi> and the Mountain <hi>Gerata;</hi> which Valley, I ſuppoſe, was that antiently called <hi>Rharius;</hi> where they held, that the firſt Wheat was ſown by <hi>Ceres</hi> Direction. The Valley is not above two or three Miles compaſs; but looks, as it were a Place both fruitful, and well cultivated. But the Plain of <hi>Lepſina,</hi> or <hi>Eleuſis,</hi> which lieth between <hi>Eleuſis,</hi> and the Mountain <hi>Daphne,</hi> is about ſeven
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:95495:184"/>or eight Miles long Weſtwards, and three or four broad from the Sea Northwards; is not ſo well tilled, but abounds with thoſe Oaks they make <hi>Vellania</hi> of: But Northwards, towards the Mountains, it is covered with Woods of Pines.</p>
               <p>At this Fountain we parted with our <hi>Conſul;</hi> and ſoon after began to climbe up the Mountain <hi>Gerata,</hi> by a way ſo ill, that we ſpent in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, and coming down, from before two a Clock till after Sun-ſet. This Mountain is called now <hi>Gerata,</hi> as well as in antient times <hi>Kerata,</hi>

                     <hi>M.</hi> GERATA. KERATA.</note> from two piked Rocks on the top; which ſhew like two Horns. On one of them is a Tower, called now <hi>Gerata-pyrga.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">PLANTS.</note> I obſerved much of the <hi>Herba Terribilis</hi> growing upon this Mountain, and of that <hi>Thorney Spurge</hi> I before mentioned; whereof I plucked up a young Root, which was long, and almoſt Bulbous; but hollow, and full of Milk. After this we paſſed through a plain for about an hour, and brought Night with us to <hi>Megara,</hi> and lodged at a <hi>Greek</hi>'s Houſe,<note place="margin">MEGARA.</note> where we were like to be choak't with Smoak; not could we have been accommodated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where better in the Town, as we were told. For Chimnies are not in faſhion with them. The only way for the Smoak to go out, is either at the Door, or at a Hole made in the top of the Room. There is a <hi>Kan</hi> indeed belonging to the Town; but ſo ill kept, that there is no Lodging in it. The next day we ſpent in ſeeing the Place, and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for its Antiquities.</p>
               <p>This Place hath preſerved its antient Name, <hi>Megara;</hi> and is ſituated in a Valley, between the Mountain <hi>Kerata</hi> North, which hath a Ridge running North-Weſtwards, to joyn with Mount <hi>Cithaeron,</hi> at the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of a Bay of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Gulph, called now <hi>Livadoſtro.</hi> The whole Mountain is called vulgarly <hi>Macriplai,</hi> or the <hi>Long Mountain.</hi> Weſtwardly, towards <hi>Corinth,</hi> the Plain is bounded with the Mountain, called now <hi>Palaio bouni,</hi> or the <hi>Old Mountain;</hi> and antiently <hi>Gerania;</hi> the Gulph of <hi>Engia,</hi> or the <hi>Saronick,</hi> South-Eaſtwards, and the Bay <hi>Livadoſtro</hi> North-Weſtwards. This Territory is not unfruitful, about it is twenty Miles compaſs; and was called in times paſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The City was built upon two little Rocks, ſtretched out South, South-Eaſt, and Weſt, North-Weſt, about two Miles from the Shore of the <hi>Saro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> Gulph. It hath the Iſle <hi>Egina</hi> in ſight, South by Eaſt, and <hi>Colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi> South-Eaſt: The antient Bounds of it yet appearing, comprehend thoſe two Rocks, and ſome part of the Plain Southwards. But now it is only built upon one of the Rocks, conſiſting of pitiful Cottages, whoſe Walls are ſometimes only the broken Stones of her Ruins, or Clay dried in the Sun, covered only with Faggots, and thoſe again ſpread over with Earth above them. They are built cloſe together; but are only of one Story high; and may be about three or four hundred in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. In the middle of the Town, on the higheſt point of the Rock, is a Tower; where a <hi>Veivode</hi> lived, until the <hi>Corſairs</hi> came, and took him away: which hath ever ſince ſo skared the <hi>Turks,</hi> that they durſt no longer ſtay there. So that they are now wholly without <hi>Turks</hi> in the Town. But the Chriſtians that are, ſtand in ſuch great fear of the Pirates, whether <hi>Turks,</hi> or <hi>Infidels,</hi> pretending to be <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſight of every Boat in the day-time, and but hearing their Dogs bark in the night, they preſently fall to packing up their few Goods, which
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:95495:185" rendition="simple:additions"/>they hide as well as they can, and run away. Not long ſince the <hi>French Conſul</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> made an Agreement between them and <hi>Crevelly,</hi> the chief of the Pirates of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> to give him yearly an hundred and fifty Meaſures of Corn, to let them live in quiet.

For not a Mile from <hi>Megara,</hi> we began to aſcend the Mountain <hi>Palaio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouni,</hi> by the lower way. For there are two, the one over the top of the Mountain, and the other along the ſide of it. This hath a very deep precipice on the left hand, unto the Sea, and the Mountain a vaſt height above it; and is worthily called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>Bad Way:</hi> For it is one of the worſt I ever travell'd, for narrowneſs, raggedneſs, and danger of falling down, ſome a hundred Yards headlong into the Sea; which the leaſt ſtumble of our Horſes might eaſily effect. This way, in antient times, was famous for the Robber <hi>Sciron;</hi> who from thence threw head-long into the Sea, all ſuch as he had robbed, until <hi>Theſeus</hi> came; who was too hard for him, and juſtly made him taſte the ſame Puniſhment he ſo barbarouſly had inflicted upon others, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him into the Sea from a rocky Precipice: Whence it was antiently called <hi>Scironides rupes,</hi> or <hi>Scironiaſaxa.</hi> The Road is at this time little leſs infeſted with the <hi>Ambuſcades</hi> of <hi>Corſairs,</hi> than it was of old by that Thief. <hi>Turks</hi> themſelves dread and tremble to go this way, when ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary occaſions force them to it, for fear of theſe People; inſomuch, that one <hi>Turk</hi> happening to be on this Road at the time we paſſed by, ſeeing us to be <hi>Francks,</hi> and knowing the <hi>Engliſh Druggerman</hi> that went with us, was glad to joyn himſelf to us, and for greater ſecurity, to pull off his Turbant, and make a Girdle of it, leaving only a red Skull-Cap upon his Head, like a <hi>Greek.</hi> This whole Mountain was called, in old time, <hi>Gerania;</hi> becauſe <hi>Megarus</hi> eſcaped thither in <hi>Deucalion</hi>'s Flood, being guided by the noiſe of Cranes, called in <hi>Greek</hi>

                  </gap>; as I have elſewhere proved. It is a very high Mountain; of which theſe high Cliffs are but upon the ſide, a great way below the higheſt Point; though they themſelves are of a great height from the Sea. As we paſſed along, I obſerv'd the Wind to precipitate it ſelf ſtrangely down from the top of the Mountain,<note place="margin">WIND.</note> into the Sea: ſome Blaſts ſeeming to fall right down upon the Surface of the Water, and there to be divided three or four ſeveral ways, making the Waves to foam as it went. Sometimes I ſaw the Water agitated for ſeveral Furlongs round about, and in other parts ſmooth and calm at the ſame time, for a conſiderable while together; which was a Divertiſement to us, while we paſſed along that dangerous Road. Much time we ſpent in ſcrambling up and down theſe Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; which done, we continued along the Shore under the Mountain, until we came to an antient Monument about mid-way from <hi>Megara</hi> to <hi>Corinth;</hi> being raiſed up three or four Yards from the Ground, and eight ſquard. About it lay ſeveral large Planks of Marble, ſome with <hi>Baſſo-relievd's</hi> upon them, and ſome without. One of which hath a Man
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:95495:187"/>walking on foot, and a Horſe paſſing by him the other way. Another hath a Figure in a lying Poſture; but much defaced. Not far from hence the antient <hi>Cromium</hi> ought to have been ſituated; which was ſometimes the Bounds between <hi>Attica</hi> and <hi>Peloponneſus:</hi> But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this was the <hi>Pedeſtal</hi> to the Pillar, that King <hi>Theſeus</hi> ſet up to be the Bounds between his <hi>Athenians,</hi> and the <hi>Peloponneſians,</hi> I dare not ſay; but rather think it was ſome <hi>Octogone</hi> Temple: For the Pillar ſhould be further within the <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> where the <hi>Iſthmian</hi> Games were celebrated. It may well enough be that Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Latona,</hi> which <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſpeaks of, and placeth hereabouts.</p>
               <p>From this antient Monument the plain Ground beginneth to enlarge it ſelf, between the Mountain <hi>Palaio-vouni,</hi> and the <hi>Saronick</hi> Shoar; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Mountain and plain Ground conſidered together, rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to grow narrow towards the narroweſt Place of the <hi>Iſthmus.</hi> It makes as much cultivable Ground, as the Plain of <hi>Megara;</hi> but it is utterly neglected, and uninhabited for fear of the <hi>Corſairs.</hi> This was that Spot of Ground, ſo much diſputed for between the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Peloponneſians;</hi> and afterwards by the <hi>Megarians,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Corinth.

                  <hi>Vernon</hi>'s Calculation, thirty-eight Degrees, fourteen Minutes Latitude. It is not big enough now, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Title of a City; but may very well paſs for a good conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Country Town. It conſiſts of the Caſtle, and the Town below it, North of it, and at almoſt a Miles diſtance nearer the Sea. The low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Town lieth pleaſantly upon an eaſie Deſcent of the Ground towards the Gulph of <hi>Lepanto.</hi> The Buildings are not cloſe together; but in parcels, of half a dozen, or half a ſcore, ſometimes twenty together; but ſeldom more; with Gardens of <hi>Orange</hi>-trees, <hi>Lemons,</hi> and <hi>Cypreſs</hi>-trees about them, ſet with more Regularity, than is uſual in theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; and ſuch a diſtance is between the ſeveral Parcels, or Buildings, as that they have Corn-fields between them. The Houſes are more ſpruce here, than ordinary; and the biggeſt quarter is, where the <hi>Bazar,</hi> or Market-place is, conſiſting of about fourſcore, or an hundred Houſes. There are two <hi>Moſques</hi> here, and one ſmall Church, called <hi>Panagia;</hi> at

                  <hi>Paul</hi>'s Preaching, Pains, or Care of this famous Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> are now to be obſerved there.</p>
               <p>The next day we went firſt to ſee <hi>Panagioti Caballari,</hi> a Merchant of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> living moſt commonly here; and letting him underſtand our Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, by enquiring after the Antiquities of the Place, he ſhewed us preſently, in his Cellar, a fair Inſcription in <hi>Latine,</hi> of <hi>Fauſtina,</hi> Wife of the Emperour <hi>Antoninus Pius.</hi> Some diſtance Weſtwards off this, and upon a Ground ſomewhat higher than the <hi>Bazar,</hi> we went to ſee eleven Pillars ſtanding upright. They were of the <hi>Dorick</hi> Order, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelled like thoſe about the Temple of <hi>Minerva,</hi> and <hi>Theſeus</hi> at <hi>Athens:</hi> the matter of which Pillars we found to be ordinary hard Stone, not Marble: But their Proportion extraordinary; for they are eighteen foot about; which makes ſix foot <hi>Diameter,</hi> and not above twenty foot and an half high; the <hi>Cylinder</hi> being twenty, and the Capitals two and an half. Whereas, according to <hi>Pliny,</hi> the <hi>Dorick Order</hi> ſhould have the Shaft ſix times longer than the <hi>Diameter;</hi> as thoſe of <hi>Athens,</hi> which have more, rather than leſs. But theſe are little above half ſo much. There is a Pillar ſtanding within theſe, which hath the ſame <hi>Diameter;</hi> but is much taller than the others, although it hath part broken off, and neither Capital, nor Architrave, remaining near it: ſo that of what Order it was, is yet uncertain. The others are placed ſo with their Architraves, that they ſhew, they made a <hi>Portico</hi> about the <hi>Cella</hi> of the Temple: And the ſingle Pillar is placed ſo towards the Weſtern-end with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as ſhews it ſupported the Roof of the <hi>Pronaes.</hi> There is alſo another Ruin on the North-ſide of the <hi>Bazar,</hi> of Brick-work; which looks like part of ſome Temple, or a <hi>Roman</hi> Bath.</p>
               <p>This Town is governed by ſuch Officers of the <hi>Grand Signior's,</hi> as other great Towns of his Empire are; that is to ſay, by a <hi>Caddi,</hi> a <hi>Vei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vode,</hi> and <hi>Haga</hi> of the Caſtle. From the firſt of theſe we had a Summons, at our return Home to our Lodging, to appear before him, and give an Account of our ſelves, and of our Curioſity. For we had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to take the Meaſures of thoſe Pillars, and to be very obſerving of the Place. But the <hi>Caddi,</hi> ſo ſoon as he underſtood by our <hi>Druggerman,</hi> that we were <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſhewing him our Conſul's Patent from the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> to travel where we pleaſed; he told us, The <hi>Engliſh</hi> were Friends of his Emperour's that we were therefore welcom, and might go whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and when we pleaſed. This <hi>Caddi</hi> is counted to have at leaſt three hundred Villages under his Juriſdiction: But theſe are little better, than ſo many Farms, up and down the Plain, between them and <hi>Sicyon;</hi> of which the <hi>Veivode,</hi> 'tis thought, hath the greateſt ſhare of the Profit. When it was known, how civilly the <hi>Caddi</hi> had uſed us, we obtain'd Leave to ſee the Caſtle, with leſs difficulty, by the Mediation of a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Dollers to one of the four <hi>Haga's,</hi> whoſe turn it then was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Caſtle. We went thither on Horſe-back, it being a good hours work to get up to it from the Town; for it is a Mile thence to the foot of the Hill; and thence a very ſteep way up, with many Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Turnings, before one arrives at the firſt Gate. The <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as the Caſtle was antiently called, is ſituated upon a very high Rock, having a great Precipice round about it; but not ſo deep on the
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:95495:189"/>South-Weſt ſide, where the Entrance is. For thence runs out a Ridge of the Hill, two or three Miles Southwards, in the <hi>Morea:</hi> And from thence it was, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Second made his Aſſault, when he took it from the <hi>Venetians,</hi> after fourteen Months Siege; that ſide of the Caſtle being the only place, where it is pregnable.</p>
               <p>The firſt Gate we came to, is plated with Iron; where we were made to alight, to go in on foot. This ſide of the Rock is well covered with Houſes: For not only thoſe who ſtill reſide there, as well <hi>Turks</hi> as <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> have their Houſes and Families there; but for the moſt part, even thoſe that dwell below in the Town, have Houſes alſo in the Caſtle; where they keep all their beſt Goods ſafe from the frequent, but very uncourteous Viſits of the <hi>Corſairs:</hi> and hither, upon the leaſt Alarm, they come flocking with all they can bring with them. The Houſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, being either Houſes of Pleaſure belonging to <hi>Turks</hi> of Quality; or ſuch as have been built both by <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conveniency of Trade and Buſineſs. There are abundance of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns for Water, hewn into the Rock, and ſome Springs; eſpecially one, which is toward the Southern-ſide of the Hill, which was called, in times paſt, <hi>Pyrene;</hi> being the Place where <hi>Bellerophon</hi> took the Winged Horſe <hi>Pegaſus,</hi> as he was there drinking.</p>
               <p>There are three or four <hi>Moſques</hi> in the Caſtle, and five or ſix ſmall Churches; but moſt of theſe ruined. The <hi>Catholica</hi> is kept in repair; but is a very mean Place for ſuch an Eccleſiaſtical Dignity. In it we ſaw two old Manuſcripts of the Scripture, divided according to the uſual Readings of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church; and two Liturgies of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Baſil:</hi> which we took to be very antient, becauſe written upon long Scrolls of Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, rouled upon Rolls of Wood, as Books uſed to be in antient times; whence they were called in <hi>Latine, Volumina.</hi> We obſerved moreover, That theſe Liturgies differed from thoſe ordinarily printed at <hi>Venice,</hi> and uſed in their Churches, both in the Subſtance and Ceremony. But as to the Two Epiſtles written to this Church by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> we had but little Account, and as little of their Zeal to his Doctrine as antiently. Under the Walls of the Caſtle towards the Town, is a little Chapel hewn out of the Rock, and dedicated to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul:</hi> Whence, when they rally, or ſpeak with reproach of any of that Quarter of the Town, they uſually tell them, They are <hi>of the Race of the Mockers,</hi> and thoſe that <hi>laught at St.</hi> Paul's <hi>Preaching:</hi> Of whom it is reported, when one of them received the <hi>Sanctified Bread</hi> from the Hand of a Prieſt, according to the manner of their Liturgy, That he almoſt bit off the Prieſt's Finger; and after that, running mad, finally hang'd himſelf upon the Point of a Rock, that is over that Chapel. And the truth is, the Chriſtians here, for want of good Inſtruction, and able and faithful Paſtors to teach them, run daily into Apoſtaſie, and renounce their Religion for the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Superſtition, upon every ſmall Calamity, and Diſcontent that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to them; and this not only among the common People, but even the Prieſts alſo: of which they ſay, There were three ſad Examples, not long before our being there.</p>

               <p>From the firſt Gate we mounted yet higher, and came to a ſecond; which is well and ſtrongly built, with two Towers on each ſide of it. This Wall I gueſs to be about two Miles in compaſs, having ſome Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes inhabited, but many more ruined within them. The two principal Points of the Rock are incloſed in them alſo. On the one, ſituated South-Weſt of the other, is a Tower built; and on the other, being the higheſt Point, a little <hi>Moſque.</hi> To the Top of this laſt we moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and had one of the moſt agreeable Proſpects this World could give us. On the right hand of us, the <hi>Saronick</hi> Gulph, with all its little Iſlands, ſtrowed up and down in it, to <hi>Capo Colonni,</hi> or the <hi>Promonte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium Sunium.</hi> Beyond that, the Iſlands of the <hi>Archipelago</hi> ſeemed to cloſe up the Mouth of the Gulph. On the left hand of us, we had the Gulph of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> or <hi>Corinth,</hi> as far as beyond <hi>Sicyon</hi> bounded Northward with all thoſe famous Mountains of old times, with the <hi>Iſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> even to <hi>Athens,</hi> lying in a row, and preſenting themſelves orderly to our view. This, with all the little Skill I had, I deſigned, and wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſelf a better Maſter in that Art, that I might have given you a more perfect <hi>Idea</hi> of it; the Particulars I obſerved, are theſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>The Promontory by <hi>Sicyon,</hi> now called <hi>Baſilico,</hi> where the Gulph of <hi>Lepanto</hi> turneth, bears North-Weſt by North.</p>

               <p>The Promontory <hi>Anticyrrha,</hi> now called <hi>Aſpropiti,</hi> with the Bay of the ſame Name; and beyond it the higheſt Point of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Heliocoro,</hi> covered with Snow, North.</p>

               <p>The Foot of the Mountain <hi>Gerania,</hi> dividing the Gulph into two Bays; the one making the Bay of <hi>Corinth</hi> on this ſide, and the other making the Bay of <hi>Livadoſtro</hi> behind it. Above this, North, North-Eaſt, is the Mountain <hi>Helicon,</hi> with a high Bunch on its Back, like a Camel; and now called <hi>Zagara-Bouni,</hi> in the ſame Point.</p>
               <p>The higheſt point of the Mountain <hi>Gerania,</hi> now called <hi>Palaio Bouni,</hi> between <hi>Megara</hi> and <hi>Corinth</hi> in the <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> North-Eaſt by North.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iſthmus</hi> it ſelf, dividing the two Seas, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Archipelago</hi> and the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> runneth along hence Eaſt North-Eaſtwards, towards the higheſt ridge of Mount <hi>Cithaeron,</hi> now called <hi>Elatea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beyond <hi>Cithaeron</hi> Eaſtward follows Mount <hi>Parnes</hi> and <hi>Hymettus,</hi> and between them appeareth the White Temple of <hi>Minerva</hi> upon the Caſtle of <hi>Athens.</hi> By them the Iſland <hi>Coulouri.</hi> I noted them from hence Eaſt: But both by Monſieur <hi>Vernons</hi> account of the <hi>Latitude,</hi> and my own Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on Mount <hi>Hymettus,</hi> it ought to be one point more South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to wit, Eaſt by South.</p>
               <p>The Iſland <hi>Aegina</hi> in the <hi>Saronique</hi> Gulph South-Eaſt. Of the reſt of the Iſles in this Gulph I have already given an account. So I need only ſay, they appeared from hence as in a Map before me.</p>
               <p>The Plain of <hi>Corinth,</hi> towards <hi>Sicyon,</hi> or <hi>Baſilico,</hi> is well watered by two Rivulets, well Tilled, well Planted with Olive-Yards, and Vine-Yards, and having many little Villages ſcattered up and down in it, is none of the leaſt of the Ornaments of this Proſpect. The Town alſo, that lieth North of the Caſtle, in little Knots of Houſes, ſurrounded with Orchards, and Gardens of Oranges, Lemons, Citrons, and Cypreſs Trees, and mixed with Corn-fields between, is a ſight no leſs delightful. So that it is hard to judge, whether this Plain is more beautiful to the Beholders, or profitable to the Inhabitants. For it bears great plenty of Oyl, the beſt and ſweeteſt I ever taſted. Nor do they want good Wine. But as to Corn it affords ſo great plenty, as ſupplyeth the Barrenneſs of its Neighbouring Countries. And its Plenty failing, brings moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a Famine upon their Neighbours round about them. So that this might ſoon grow to be a rich, and populous Country, were they under any Government, but the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> Tyranny; and not ſo often per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted and ſpoiled by Chriſtian Pirates, who give them many trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Viſits. I was inform'd, at my return to <hi>Zant,</hi> that a conſiderable Party of Pirates had of late ſuddenly ſurprized them; and, having ſack'd and plunder'd the Town as much as they could, they at laſt hamſtring'd all their Horſes alſo, leſt the Turks ſhould make a head and purſue after them. I ſaw not many great Guns planted here: but ſome there are planted Northwards, towards the Gulph of <hi>Lepanto.</hi> Under this Weſtern Top of the Hill, is a place Walled in: which they ſay was the place where the Jews lived, when <hi>Corinth</hi> was under the <hi>Venctians.</hi> They make four diſtinct quarters of this Caſtle, each Governed by a diſtinct <hi>Haga.</hi> But their Forces conſiſt now only of the Inhabitants, <hi>Turks</hi> and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: no Jews are now amongſt them. The number of Turks and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſeem to be equal, and are eſteem'd not to exceed fifteen hundred in number, both in the Town and Caſtle; but there are many more diſperſed up and down in the <hi>Zengaries,</hi> or Villages, in the Plain which I do not now reckon.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, his nature being transformed from Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity to the Churliſhneſs of a Dog. He was one of the Magiſtrates of his City; and flattered by the Oracle, aſpir'd to the higheſt place in it by Coining of falſe money: But for this he was Chaſed from <hi>Sinope,</hi> and fled to <hi>Athens:</hi> where he came acquainted with that great Philoſopher, <hi>Antiſthenes,</hi> who diſputed ſo much againſt the ſeeking of glory. He fell afterwards, paſſing by Sea, into the hands of Pyrats, who brought him to be ſold in the publick Market-place: Where being asked what he could do, he anſwer'd <hi>Govern men,</hi> and ſeeing a certain <hi>Spendthrift</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> he deſired he might be ſold to him, becauſe <hi>he wanted a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:</hi> who bought him, and ſet him to teach his Children: where he lived and died.</p>
               <p>After this we return'd into our way again, and left the Olive-Yards and Vineyards on our right hand, which are watered by the Rivulet <hi>Ornea,</hi> running down from the Mountains, that bound this Plain South, and South-Weſtwards: and from thence, I believe runs into the River <hi>Nemea;</hi> which we paſt about mid-way by a Bridge. This River then was not very conſiderable: but after rains is poured down from the Mountains in ſuch abundance, that it fills many Channels on each ſide of it, which before were dry. In our way we paſſed by many lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:95495:192"/>Villages, and arrived at <hi>Baſilico</hi> after three hours riding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baſilico,</hi> or as ſome call it, <hi>Baſilica,</hi> was in old time a great City cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Sicyon.</hi> When the Kingdom of the <hi>Morea</hi> was under the <hi>Tenetians,</hi> it was a conſiderable Town; now it is but a heap of Ruins, and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only by three Families of <hi>Turks,</hi> and about as many <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> This final deſtruction, one of the Inhabitants told us, happened about twenty years ago by the Plague: which they held to be a Judgment of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Turks,</hi> for profaning one of the Chriſtian Churches there, turning it into a Moſque, by Command of the <hi>Vaivode;</hi> who fell down dead upon the place the firſt time he cauſed the <hi>Alchoran</hi> to be read in it: whoſe Death was followed ſoon after with ſuch a Peſtilence, as in a ſhort time utterly deſtroyed the whole Town: which could never ſince be re-peopled.</p>
               <p>It is ſituated upon a Hill about three Miles from the Gulph of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> and hath the River <hi>Aſopus</hi> running under it on the Eaſt-ſide: on which are ſome Powder-Mills, as they told us; which are the firſt I ever ſaw in <hi>Turkey.</hi> There remaineth abundance of Ruins both ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern. The Wall of the Caſtle, many Churches, and ſome Moſques: and a good way off the Caſtle Weſtwards is a Ruin they call <hi>the Kings Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace:</hi> which ſeems to be very ancient, but made of Bricks. I take it to have been a Bath, from the many Chanels down the Wall to bring Water. Beyond that at a good diſtance, is a Hill formed <hi>Semicircular,</hi> I believe by Art, and to have been a <hi>Theater,</hi> or <hi>Stadium.</hi> There are alſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Caverns and Vaults in the ground; which we could not ſtay to examine with any exactneſs: but returned part of our way towards <hi>Corinth</hi> that Evening, and lay at a little Village about midway. The next Morning we paſſed along the ſhore by ſeveral little Lakes, and the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Port of <hi>Corinth,</hi> called <hi>Lechaeum,</hi> now quite choked up. We left <hi>Corinth</hi> about two Miles off on the right hand, and went two or three Miles further to a Village they call <hi>Heximillia:</hi> where we ſpent the reſt of a wet day, becauſe we could not reach to <hi>Megara</hi> that Night: nor was there any where to lodge at in the way. This Village is called <hi>Hexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millia,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> at this place is ſix Miles wide. The next day we came early to <hi>Megara;</hi> and the day following to <hi>Athens.</hi>

After Dinner we took Horſe, and continued our Journey, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we came to <hi>Porto Raphti;</hi> which is eſteemed eighteen Miles from <hi>Athens:</hi> But I do not believe it above fourteen, or fifteen.<note place="margin">PORTO RAPHTI.</note> The Bay that maketh this Harbour is ſituated on the Eaſtern ſhore of <hi>Attica,</hi> and hath the higheſt point of Mount <hi>Hymettus</hi> Northweſt by North.

               </p>
               <p>We turned a little to the right hand thence, and after we had rode about ſix Miles further, we came to a Village called <hi>Marcopoli.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">MARCO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POLI.</note> The Ruins hard by it ſhews it to have been a conſiderable place in old time; but now it hath not above twenty or thirty Houſes remaining. Perhaps it was anciently the Town, <hi>Aegilia,</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Antïoch. Strabo</hi> calleth them <hi>Aeginenſes:</hi> but <hi>Meurſius</hi> corrects him out of <hi>Suidas</hi> and <hi>Stephanus.</hi> In ſome ruined Churches I found a few inconſiderable Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, upon Pillars and Sepulchral Monuments.</p>
               <p>The next Morning early we parted thence, and after about three
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:95495:193"/>hours riding, came to a deſolate Church, but kept in repair by the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages about it; every one of which have an Olive Tree planted by it: I ſuppoſe to ſerve for Oyl for the Lamps in the Church. Before the Church, at the Weſt end of it, is the Tomb of the Founder of the Church: upon which among the Stones, is an ancient <hi>Baſſo-relievo</hi> of a Woman in a ſedent poſture. Here groweth the biggeſt <hi>Lentiſcus</hi> Tree I ever ſaw: Out of ſeveral places of the Body of it, Tears of Maſtick Iſſued: Which convinced me, that not only at <hi>Scio,</hi> but in all theſe parts they would yield Maſtick, if they were cultivated. I gueſs alſo, that hereabouts the Town, <hi>Anaphyliſta,</hi> was ſituated, if not at the Town following, to which after an hour and a halfs riding thence, Southward, we came, being called <hi>Kerateia</hi> from the Karobs, of which I ſaw ſeveral Trees growing wild. This hath been an ancient, and great City; and did preſerve it ſelf conſiderable, until deſtroyed by the <hi>Corſairs</hi> about fifty or threeſcore years ago. They had their <hi>Epitropi,</hi> or <hi>Archontes,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til then, who did wear <hi>High-crown'd</hi> Hats, like thoſe of <hi>Athens.</hi> I could diſcern here, where an <hi>Amphitheater</hi> had been, by the Foundations, and ſome other remains of it. In the Church I found an Inſcription; which I believe would have given me ſome light concerning the Antiquity of the place, had it been better preſerv'd. From this place we were three long hours before we arriv'd at <hi>Promontorium Sunium,</hi> the way being very rocky and bad, up-hill and down-hill all along. About midway we paſt over a little Mountain, where in times paſt they digged much Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and now ſome Copper; out of which, they ſay, the Goldſmiths of <hi>Athens</hi> at preſent ſeparate a conſiderable quantity of Silver.<note place="margin">LAURIUM.</note> But they let not the <hi>Turks</hi> know ſo much, leſt the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> ſhould impoſe the Slavery of digging in the Mines upon them. I ſaw abundance of <hi>Cinders</hi> lying up and down in the wayes; which aſſured me, that in times paſt they had digg'd great quantities of Metals there. <hi>Xenophon</hi> calls this Mountain <hi>Laurium. Pauſanias</hi> and many other Authors mention it: But whether there was a Town called by the ſame name, I know not. But if ſo, it was done by <hi>Xenophons</hi> Counſel, who adviſed them to build a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle there, leſt the Mines ſhould be neglected in time of War: But if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I believe it was nearer the Sea-ſide: where there is a kind of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for Boats, to paſs over to <hi>Macroniſa.</hi>

               <p>Thence we turned yet a little further North-Weſtwards, and came
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:95495:194"/>into the way to <hi>Athens,</hi> paſſing between two Ridges of the Mountain <hi>Hymettus:</hi> that on the left hand being called <hi>Lambra-Vouni,</hi> becauſe of its nearneſs to <hi>Lambra,</hi> and the other <hi>Telo-vouni,</hi> which thence deſcends with a ſharp point into the Sea, and making a Promontory now called <hi>Halikes;</hi> but anciently <hi>Zoſter.</hi> Juſt before it are four little Iſlands, or rather Rocks; they call <hi>Camboniſia:</hi> The Button Iſland.

               <p>The Weather being very bad, Snowy, Rainy, and Windy, we were willing to ſpend that day there, being entertained by the Good Fathers with all the Courteſie imaginable: They made us an excellent Fire, which was but needful; For although there be no very great hard Froſts in theſe Countries, it is nevertheleſs ſometimes extream cold; eſpecially when the Winds blow over the Mountains covered with Snow; as then it happened to do, over <hi>Pendelico,</hi> with ſuch a force, as we were ſcarce able to ſit our Horſes, nor hinder the Cold from paſſing thorough all the Cloths we could put on: But this bad weather did not cool our Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity: ſo much, but that after we had refreſhed our ſelves, we took a Guide to go up and ſhew us the Quarries of White Marble, with the other curious Grottoes of Congelations, hewen into the ſides of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.

               <p>About this Mountain I obſerved abundance of that kind of <hi>Arbutus</hi> I before ſpoke of; and of which <hi>Matthiolus,</hi> by his Commentary upon <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> ſeems wholly ignorant.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is not much different from <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſcorides</hi> his name <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Comarus,</hi> ſaith he, is a Tree, like a Quince Tree, with a thin Bark, the Fruit of it about the bigneſs of a Plum, without a Stone; which when it is ripe, is of a reddiſh colour, and is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</q> This agrees very well with the Tree I ſpeak of: but the Deſcription is not perfect. For the Tree is indeed like a Quince Tree, the Leaves being broad like it, or rather like a Pear, and the Bark of it is thin. But withal, it ſhould be obſerv'd, it is of a reddiſh Colour, ſmooth and ſhining, as if it were po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. The Branches alſo grow at ſmall diſtances in rundles, round the Body, like the Fir-Trees, beſet with large broad Leaves, as big as thoſe of a Quince, or Pear-Tree, and very like in ſhape. Within, it is of a ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning dark Green, and without of a whitiſh Colour, and ſmooth at the Edges. At the top of the Branches I then ſaw bunches of ſmall Flowers of a whitiſh Colour; which are ſucceeded with a Fruit, in ſhape like a Pipin, but not much bigger than Cervices, of a red Colour, but dark and ſmooth, and ſomething leſſer than the ordinary <hi>Arbutus:</hi> nor hath it any Stone, but ſeed. I believe it may be that which <hi>Bellonius</hi> calls <hi>Adrach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> of <hi>Candia.</hi> But here I obſerved alſo another kind of it, without any
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:95495:195"/>conſiderable difference, that I could perceive, ſave only the length of the Leaves, and thoſe a very little ſnipped at the edges. The Fruit I ſaw at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> ripe and green, going thence to <hi>Epheſus.</hi> But here the Trees ſeemed to be much larger.</p>
               <p>We parted hence the next day about ten in the Morning, and turning about the North-Weſt ſide of the Mountain; in the Plain of <hi>Athens</hi> we came into the way that leads to <hi>Marathon:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">CEVISIA.</note> wherein we paſſed firſt by a Village about two or three Miles from <hi>Penteli,</hi> called <hi>Geviſia,</hi> or <hi>Ceviſia:</hi> of which <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was the ancient name: <hi>Herodes Atticus</hi> above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned had here one of his Country-Houſes. It is ſituate upon the ſtream, that cometh from the Mountain <hi>Pentelicus.</hi> and falleth into the <hi>Cephiſus.</hi> We perceiv'd ſome ancient Walls of Marble near the Moſque there, as we went thorough the Village.</p>
               <p>Continuing on our way, we paſſed by another ruined Village, called <hi>Stamati;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">STAMATI, and URANIA BRAURON.</note> and then proceeding over a Ridge where the Mountains <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zea</hi> and <hi>Pendeli</hi> meet, we deſcended to a Village at the foot of them called <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rania</hi> in the Plains of <hi>Marathon,</hi> about ſeven or eight Miles from <hi>Geviſia;</hi> It is inhabited by the <hi>Albaneſe</hi> Shepherds and Herdſmen, and ſituated as it were between two Buttrices of the Mountain. Its preſent name <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ranna</hi> ſeemeth to be a corruption of the ancient <hi>Brauron;</hi> which probably ſtood hereabouts, and was celebrated for the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Brauron.</hi> Here began that Province of <hi>Attica,</hi> called <hi>Diacria,</hi> or, ſometimes, <hi>Hyperdiacria,</hi> and ended at the Mountain <hi>Parnes,</hi> as <hi>Heſychius</hi> telleth us. This part of <hi>Attica</hi> was left by King <hi>Pandion</hi> to his ſecond Son, <hi>Lycus</hi> being that which lyeth oppoſite to <hi>Euboea,</hi> or <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gropont,</hi> as <hi>Strabo</hi> out of <hi>Sophocles</hi> proveth. So that I believe <hi>Diacria</hi> might contain all that Country from the <hi>Cynoſura</hi> Promontory, which is made by a Ridge of the Mountain <hi>Pentelicus,</hi> running out into the Sea from it, being not far from <hi>Brauron</hi>) and the Mountainous Country of <hi>Noſea</hi> and <hi>Caſha,</hi> as far as <hi>Oropus,</hi> being the bounds of <hi>Attica</hi> and <hi>Boeotia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rania</hi> we turned towards the left hand, under the Mountain <hi>Noſea,</hi> and after two or three Miles riding left the Town <hi>Marathon,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſtill by the ſame name, as it was anciently, although now but a poor Village, on our left hand. There we paſſed over a little River, that cometh down from the Mountain, and paſſeth by <hi>Marathon</hi> over the Plain into the Sea: and thence proceeding a Mile or two further, we paſt by a Fountain, that preſently ſeems to ſtagnate into the Lake of <hi>Marathon,</hi> ſo much celebrated for the overthrow of <hi>Xerxes</hi> his Army. Hard by this we paſſed by a ruined Tower, and an old Church; where, in all likelyhood, ſtood the ancient <hi>Tricorithus;</hi> and about a Mile further came to a little Village of the <hi>Albaneſes,</hi> called <hi>Chouli:</hi> where we lodged that Night. The Inhabitants of this place have another Village, called by the ſame name, on the Mountains, this is too cold for them and their Herds in the Winter; and that is too dry, and too much infeſted with Flies, bred out of the Lake, to be inhabited in Summer. So that it is not to be thought <hi>Luxury</hi> but <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> that makes theſe poor people provide themſelves Houſes both for Summer and Winter.<note place="margin">Lake of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rathon.</hi>
                  </note> The Lake of <hi>Marathon</hi> is covered all over with Ruſhes and Weeds, more like Marſhy and boggy ground than a Lake; and they ſay, that at ſometimes 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:95495:196"/>moſt dry. This was famous for the deſtruction of <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s Army, but now only very large Eeles breeding in it; which thoſe of the Covent <hi>Pendeli</hi> come and fiſh for: who have a <hi>Metochi,</hi> or Farm, thereabouts, where ſome of the <hi>Caloiro's</hi> live, and look after the <hi>Boufolo's;</hi> which love extreamly to feed and wallow in the mire of it.</p>
               <p>The next Morning we took Horſe, and rode three or four Miles fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Northward from the lower <hi>Chouli,</hi> and came to the Shore oppoſite to <hi>Euboea,</hi> to an old ruined Town they call <hi>Tauro-castro,</hi> ſometimes <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braeo-caſtro,</hi> fituate in the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of a <hi>Peninſula,</hi> that bounds the Plain of <hi>Marathon</hi> beyond the Lake Northwards: where the Shore of <hi>Attica</hi> makes a conſiderable Promontory. Thence the Promontory <hi>Sunium</hi> lies directly South: But thence towards <hi>Negropont</hi> it makes a crook, and turns North-Weſt. This Promontory was undoubtedly called in ancient times <hi>Cherſoneſſus Promontorium,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">CHERSO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESSUS.</note> and this ruin'd Town <hi>Rhamnus,</hi> celebrated all over <hi>Greece</hi> for the Temple of <hi>Nemeſis</hi> that was there; the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-ſhip of whoſe Statue was much admired. The Ruins of this Temple are yet to be ſeen upon a Hill in the middle of the <hi>Iſthmus;</hi> being at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent only a heap of White Marble. From the Caſtle here I ſaw a high Mountain of <hi>Euboea,</hi> North-North-Weſt: which I believe, is that called now <hi>Delphi.</hi> Over againſt this place Eaſt-North-Eaſt, is a Harbour of the ſame Iſland, called <hi>Porto-Bufalo;</hi> and the Southern Promontory of it alſo called <hi>Capo Kariſto</hi> South-South-Eaſt. From the Temple of <hi>Neme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> turning about, we had <hi>Porto Raphti,</hi> and beyond that <hi>Capo-Colonni,</hi> South, <hi>Macroniſa</hi> South by Eaſt. Some other Iſlands <hi>South, South-Eaſt,</hi> between that and <hi>Capo Cariſto,</hi> as I think, <hi>Zea.</hi> We ſearched about for the Grotto of the God <hi>Pan,</hi> in old times very much celebrated in theſe parts; but could neither find it, nor hear any news of it.</p>
               <p>From hence it would have been our nearer way to <hi>Negropont</hi> to have gone directly on; but they told us, there was no way thence over the Mountain <hi>Noſea:</hi> for that coming along from the Mountain <hi>Pentelicus</hi> it ends here towards the Sea in unpaſſable Rocks and Precipices. We were therefore forced to return as far back as <hi>Marathon,</hi> to recover our way to <hi>Negropont:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">MARA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THON.</note> 
                  <hi>Marathon</hi> is now but a pitiful ruined Village which we thought not worth alighting to ſee, therefore leaving it a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it, we began to go up the Mountain <hi>Noſea,</hi> our way lying along the River I before ſpake of, which here and there makes little Cataracts, or falls of Water, as it deſcendeth into the Plain.

                  <note place="margin">KALINGI.</note> upon the ſide of the Mountain; and about as far more on the Plain on the top of the Mountain, another cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Capandritti,</hi>

Whence I ſaw the higheſt point of Mount <hi>Hymettus,</hi> and <hi>Pentelicus</hi> Southwards, the Gulf of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gropont,</hi> or <hi>Euripus,</hi> North; Mount <hi>Caſha,</hi> or <hi>Parnes,</hi> Weſtwards. On this Mountain is a large Plain, bounded with the high Mountains of <hi>Caſha,</hi> and its own higheſt Cliffs towards the Plain of <hi>Marathon;</hi> being a great Portion, or part of <hi>Diacria</hi> above-mention'd. As to the ancient name
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:95495:196"/>of this Mountain, although from <hi>Pentelicus</hi> hither I heard of no other preſent name that it hath then <hi>Noſea,</hi> or <hi>Nozea;</hi> yet I gueſs it had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly two names: Firſt, That part which reacheth from <hi>

And then it ſeems naturally to be ſevered at <hi>Marathon</hi> by the River: whence it ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſtill higher and higher towards the North end, and alſo towards the South, making two diſtinct Ridges; but chiefly, becauſe I know not where to place the Mountain <hi>Lycobettus,</hi> but here; and that with ſome probability from the name <hi>Lycabetus:</hi> which ſeemeth to be derived, either from <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, ſignifying a Wolf; with which the deſart and rocky places of this Mountain might be infeſted: or laſtly from <hi>Lycus,</hi> ſecond Son to <hi>Pandion,</hi> King of <hi>Athens;</hi> whoſe Heritage, left him by the King his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was all that Mountainous Country, lying towards the Iſland of <hi>Euboea,</hi> and was called <hi>Diacria</hi> and <hi>Huperdiacria,</hi> and therefore moſt likely the Mountain bearing his name was in his Country.</p>
               <p>From the top of this Mountain we deſcended, about an hour and more, along a torrent, and came by that time it was dark, to a Town on the ſide of the Mountain called <hi>Marcopoli.</hi> The Inhabitants of this place were once, not long ſince, about to run away for Poverty and Debt: But the Benignity of the Captain <hi>Baſha,</hi> who alloweth them the third of their labour, and the ground; hath hitherto kept about fifty or three-ſcore Families of them together, to inhabit there. By ſome fragments of Antiquity ſtill remaining; This place ſhould have been, in ancient times, more conſiderable than now it ſeems. Perhaps it was <hi>Hyttania,</hi> afterwards called <hi>Tetrapolis,</hi> becauſe it had four Towns under it, viz. <hi>Marathon, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balinthus, Tricorithus</hi> and <hi>Oinea.</hi> For ſo I underſtand <hi>Stephanus Byzan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus,</hi> although others take it to be no particular Town, or City, but all the four Towns jointly to be called by that common name, <hi>Tetrapolis.</hi> But theſe ſeem not to have read far enough in the <hi>Lexicon,</hi> nor to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what <hi>Stephens</hi> there quoteth out of <hi>Androſion:</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The next day we parted early, and deſcending yet lower on the ſide of the Mountain, we came to the ſhore of <hi>Euripus;</hi> along which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our way two hours and a halfs riding, we came to the mouth of the
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:95495:197"/>River <hi>Aſopus,</hi> which we had formerly paſſed over in our way to <hi>Athens</hi> from <hi>Thebes,</hi> but was now there ſo ſwelled with the Rains that had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from the Mountain <hi>Parnes,</hi> that we could not paſs it over on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back. Therefore we continued our way along the Banks, till we came to <hi>Oropo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">OROPUS.</note> a large Town, conſiſting, I believe, of two hundred Houſes. This was undoubtedly the ancient Town <hi>Oropus,</hi> in the Confines of <hi>Attica</hi> and <hi>Boeotia,</hi> ſo much conteſted for between the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Thebans:</hi> It is ſituated two or three Miles from the Sea, upon the <hi>Attick</hi> ſide of the River;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Thycydidis</hi> lib. 2.</note> the Region about it being formerly called <hi>Pyrace;</hi> and is, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, the narrow Plain under <hi>Parnes</hi> and <hi>Lycobettus,</hi> on the Southſide of the <hi>Aſopus.</hi> About two or three Miles further, being Noon, we paſſed over the River <hi>Aſopus</hi> by a Ferry, to a Village called <hi>Scamino;</hi> And then we judged our ſelves quite out of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Territories. And again in <hi>Boeotia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scamino</hi> is a Town almoſt as big as <hi>Oropus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">SCAMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NO.</note> and is ſituated on the other ſide of the River, under a ſteep Hill North-Eaſt of it; whereon, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve alſo, the greateſt part of the ancient Town was built. My Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion thinks, that it was called in times paſt <hi>Sycaminon,</hi> as I gueſs, from <hi>Laurenburgius:</hi> But I know not their reaſon. I believe it to have been a place more conſiderable than ſuch an obſcure Village, if ſuch a one there ever was; for I can no where find it. The ancient Ruins of this place ſhew it to have been a large City; The Greeks have yet many Churches in it: among the reſt <hi>Hagioi ſeranda,</hi> or the Church of <hi>Forty Saints, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagia,</hi> and <hi>Hagios Elias:</hi> which are built out of ancient Ruins; among which we obſerved ſome Inſcriptions. By one we ſhould have judg'd this place to have been <hi>Oropus,</hi> had not the true <hi>Oropus</hi> ſo well preſerved its ancient name. I take the Hill by it to be that called <hi>Cerycius Mons</hi> in more ancient times: And the Town to have been <hi>Tanagra,</hi> ſo much ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, and deſcribed laſt on the River <hi>Aſopus,</hi> by the ancients: It was called firſt <hi>Paemandria,</hi> after that <hi>Graea,</hi> and <hi>Tanagraea,</hi> as <hi>Pauſanias;</hi> but now <hi>Scamino.</hi> Thence it is about three hours riding to <hi>Negropont:</hi> in the way to which we paſſed by a Village called <hi>Dramiſh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">DRAMISH.</note> inhabited only by Fiſhermen: and within three or ſour Miles of <hi>Negropont,</hi> a Port cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led yet <hi>Megalo Bathy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">MEGALO BATHY.</note> or <hi>Vathi:</hi> of which <hi>Strabo</hi> takes notice by the ſame name, ſignifying <hi>Portus Profundus.</hi> Near this there is another ſmall Bay called <hi>Micro Bathy;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">MICRO BATHY.</note> and laſtly there is a large Bay, which hath two nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Entrances; one on this ſide, and the other at the City; making the famous <hi>Streight</hi> of the <hi>Euripus.</hi> This Bay hath good Moorage all over, and was the famous Port <hi>Aulis</hi> in times paſt, where all the <hi>Grecian</hi> Fleet aſſembled to go againſt the <hi>Trojans.</hi> But of the Town <hi>Aulis,</hi> we obſerved no remainder, although it was, for certain, near <hi>Chalcis.</hi> now called <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gropont</hi> by the <hi>Francks:</hi> where we arrived in very good time, and went and lodged at the Houſe of one <hi>Gioſeppe Roſſo,</hi> formerly a Slave of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta;</hi> but now bears the Character of <hi>French Conſul</hi> there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Negropont</hi> is called by the <hi>Grecians Egripos,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">NEGRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PONT. EGRIPOS. EVRIPUS.</note> as well the City as the Iſland: which is very probably a corruption of the word <hi>Evripus:</hi> which the <hi>Greeks</hi> would pronounce <hi>Evripos,</hi> making the <hi>V</hi> after another Vowel, ſound as the <hi>Latines,</hi> and we do the <hi>V</hi> Conſonant, and ſometimes like an <hi>F,</hi> or <hi>Ph.</hi> But the barbarous name, by which the <hi>Italians,</hi> and we from them, call it, hath no foundation for it, but the ignorance of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:95495:197"/>For there is no ſuch thing as a <hi>Black Bridge</hi> over the <hi>Euripus,</hi> for them to call it <hi>Negropont</hi> from it. Perhaps they might hear the Greeks ſay, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The City <hi>Egripus</hi> then is upon or hard by the place where <hi>Chalcis</hi> ſtood formerly; that is, on a <hi>Peninſula</hi> of the Iſland anciently called <hi>Euboea:</hi> and is there ſeparated from <hi>Boeotia</hi> by a narrow ſtreight: which is paſſed over firſt by a ſmall Stone-Bridge of four or five Arches, to a little Tower built by the <hi>Venetians</hi> in the middle of the Chanel: from whence to the Town is a Draw-Bridge, no larger than to let a Gally paſs thorough. The Walls of the Town are not above two Miles about: But there are more Buildings and People in the Suburbs of the Chriſtians beyond, than in the City, where only <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> inhabit. The Turks have two Moſques within, and two without: where the Chriſtians have alſo their Churches. The City is ſeparated from the Suburbs by a deep Ditch; and the Inhabitants of both may amount, probably, to fourteen or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand people. There are ſix or ſeven Families of the <hi>Francks</hi> among them; and a Seminary of <hi>Jeſuits:</hi> who pretend to be there only to teach their Children; but withal, to do as much ſervice to the <hi>Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts</hi> as they can.</p>
               <p>This is the chief reſidence of the Captain <hi>Baſha,</hi> or General of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet, who is Governour both of this City and Iſland, and the Adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent parts of <hi>Greece;</hi> having a <hi>Keiah,</hi> or Deputy under him. A Fleet of Gallies ſtill lie here, to be ready upon all occaſions to go out againſt the Pyrates, and thoſe of <hi>Malta.</hi> His Palace is without the Town, upon the Shore, North-Eaſt off the Bridge: Fortified only by the Gallies faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the ſhore above it. His Brother <hi>Achmet Baſha</hi> lives in the Town, at the Palace, which was the reſidence of the <hi>Proveditore</hi> of the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> before this Iſland was taken from them, by <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Second. This is ſituate on the ſhore on the Eaſtern-ſide of the Bridge, and therein we were ſhewed ſome Vaults, with ſecret Paſſages to go out with Boats to the <hi>Euripus:</hi> where the <hi>Proveditore</hi> of that unhappy time of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily <hi>Erizzo</hi> endeavoured to eſcape, but was diſcovered by Spies, taken, and moſt barbarouſly put to death by that Cruel Tyrant and Enemy to Chriſtendom.</p>
               <p>His fair Daughter, <hi>Signora Anna,</hi> though ſhe had an equal ſhare of her Fathers unhappy Fate, yet thereby purchaſed to her ſelf ſuch Glory as is worth many times the dying for. For ſhe being courted to his Bed, by the offers of the Empire of the World, by the lure of Crowns and Scepters to tread on, to be made ſhine with all the glittering Jewels of the Eaſt, ſcorned and contemned them, chuſing rather the bloody Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard than all that dazling Grandeur, with the impious and foul Embraces of that Incarnate Devil her Fathers Murderer. Inſomuch that <hi>Mahomet</hi> being enraged to ſee his Luſt, his Glory and his Power ſo mightily op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and defeated by the Virtue of a tender and weak Virgin, drew out his Cimiter, and in his Fury hewed her all to pieces. Her Memory
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:95495:198"/>is Sacred among the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and highly deſerves to be Enroll'd among Glorious Martyrs.</p>
               <p>On the Walls of this Palace we found an Inſcription bearing date MCCLXXIII. which ſpeaks of a work then begun in the Month of <hi>May</hi> 409. Years ago, and Dedicated to the Honour of God, and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  <hi>Egripo</hi> is a place very well ſerv'd with all manner of Proviſions, at very low rates. Mutton is ſcarce worth a penny a pound. Kids and Goats fleſh not above an half-penny; Fiſh will not ſell for more than a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the pound. Wine is about two pence the <hi>Crondriry,</hi> that is, about our Wine-Gallon. Here alſo they make <hi>Sweetmeals</hi> of all ſorts of Fruits, Quinces, Pears, Plums, Nuts, Wallnuts and Almonds for Sugar; they uſe Wine boil'd to a Syrup, and make them grateful enough to the taſt; yet I believe they would hardly pleaſe ſome of our nice Ladies, unleſs, perhaps, becauſe they were far fetch'd.</p>
               <p>We ſhould be extreamly to blame,<note place="margin">Of the Ebbing and Flowing of the <hi>Euripus.</hi>
                  </note> if we had not endeavour'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our ſelves, as much as poſſible, concerning the wonderful Ebbing and Flowing of the <hi>Euripus,</hi> ſo juſtly admired in all Ages, for one of the great wonders of the World. Our ſtay here was not long enough to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all the various changings of its Tydes our ſelves: But I ſhall give you the beſt account of it I can, from the Informations we had from the Inhabitants and other ingenious men that have reſided long there; and not content my ſelf to tell you only, that it kept its Motion according to the Tydes of the Ocean, the two days I ſtaid there, and obſerved it. The moſt exact account of it we had from the Jeſuits, and that confirm'd by the Millers, who have Mills on it, and therefore by long experience and obſervation ſhould know the truth beſt. They all agreed, that its Tydes were ſometimes regular, and ſometimes irregular, according to the different times of the Moon. But the Reverend Father <hi>Babin</hi> writ all the particulars of his Obſervations, in an ingenious Letter to his Friend, the Abbot <hi>Pecoil</hi> at <hi>Lyons:</hi> which I will not undertake wholly
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:95495:198"/>to tranſcribe; but in ſhort give you the ſum of them, as followeth.</p>
               <p>Firſt he obſerveth, that this Ebbing and Flowing is perceived ten or a dozen Leagues off, on each ſide of the ſtreight, in ſeveral little Bayes along the Shore, by the riſing and falling of the Water.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That its courſe may be conſidered as it is in divers times. For it is regular eighteen or nineteen dayes every Month, or rather every Moon, and eleven dayes irregular, or ſpoiled, according to the terms they uſe at <hi>Negropont,</hi> to explain this wonder of nature.</p>
               <p>It is regular from the three laſt dayes of the old Moon to the eighth of the New. The ninth it is irregular, and continues ſo till the thirteenth incluſively. The fourteenth it recovereth it ſelf again till the one and twentieth excluſively, when it begins again to be irregular until the twenty ſeventh: as it will be more eaſie to underſtand by the following Table.</p>

               <p>The dayes that it is Irregular, it flows and ebbs, eleven, twelve, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, and ſometimes fourteen times in the ſpace of four, or five and twenty hours, as the Father ſaith, he hath obſerv'd himſelf, and was aſſured by thoſe that keep the Mills, and ſee the Wheels of them change very often every day, according to the different courſe of the Water. The Tyde therefore changeth here, not only ſeven times a day, as the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents did report, but a great many times more. For he ſaith, he ſtaid at one time an hour and half, and ſaw it change his courſe three times, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Wind blew pretty hard againſt it. In theſe days the riſing of the Water is about half an hour, and the falling about three quarters: But the days that it is Regular, it obſerves the ſame Rules, according to the Moon, as the Ocean and <hi>Venetian</hi> Gulph doth; that is to ſay, that in four or five and twenty hours, it hath two Flowings in, and as many Eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings out, loſeth near an hour every day, and is ſix hours mounting one way, and as many going back the other way. Thus it doth Winter and Summer, in high Winds and calm Weather.</p>
               <p>The differences he obſerved between its both Regular and Irregular Tydes, and thoſe of the Ocean are theſe. The <hi>Euripus</hi> at High Water
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:95495:199"/>riſeth ordinarily but a foot, or little more, and very ſeldom reacheth to two feet: Whereas the Ocean, in many places on the European ſhores, riſeth eighty Cubits high, although in the Iſles of <hi>America</hi> he obſerved it to riſe no higher than in the <hi>Euripus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond difference that he obſerv'd, was, that the Ocean, when it Ebbs, retireth towards the full Sea; and when it flows, or riſeth higher, it runs towards the Coaſts. But the <hi>Euripus</hi> obſerves another Rule. For its riſing Water is, when it runs towards the Iſles of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> where the Sea is greateſt: and its Falling, or Ebb, when it runs towards <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaly,</hi> that is, Northwards.</p>
               <p>Between the Ebbing and Flowing of <hi>Euripus</hi> is a little ſpace of time, wherein the Water ſeems to ſtand ſtill: inſomuch that Feathers or Straws caſt on it cannot be perceiv'd to move in calm weather upon the ſurface of the Water; all theſe Obſervations this ingenious Father aſſures us he often made aboard the Veſſels lying in the Harbour; where he had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to do it when, as often, and as long a time as he pleaſed. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds alſo to make an ingenious Diſcourſe concerning the Opinions of the ancients touching <hi>Euripus,</hi> and the cauſes of its various and irregular Motions; for ſatisfaction herein I refer my Reader to him: adding only that I obſerved, the Chanel of the <hi>Euripus</hi> here maketh ſuch a turn, that its courſe from the Bridge runneth South-South-Weſt, which is towards <hi>Attica</hi> and the Iſlands of the <hi>Archipelago;</hi> and the other towards <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> North-North-Eaſt.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> the ſixth of <hi>March</hi> 1676. we left <hi>Egripo,</hi> and arrived at <hi>Thebes</hi> after about ſix hours riding. In the way we paſſed over an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent high Mountain, about two Miles from <hi>Egripo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">TYPO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VOUNI. MESSAPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>US MONS.</note> called now <hi>Typo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouni:</hi> But I believe anciently <hi>Meſſapius Mons.</hi> From the higheſt place in the paſſage over it, we obſerved <hi>Egripo,</hi> Eaſt by North. The furtheſt part we could ſee of the Iſland <hi>Euboea,</hi> North; and the way to <hi>Thepes,</hi> which was before us, South-Weſt. About midway we left another Hill on our right hand; which I believe was anciently called <hi>Teumeſſus:</hi> but the preſent name thereof is <hi>Aſomata,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ASOMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TA.</note> ſo called from a Monaſtery of that name ſituated on it: though in old time it had <hi>Micaleſſus</hi> either on it, or very nigh unto it. By it I alſo obſerv'd the paſſage over <hi>Typovouni</hi> was Eaſt-North Eaſt, and <hi>Thebes</hi> in a ſtreight line before us, Weſt-South-Weſt. Proceeding a little further we croſſed a ſmall ſtream, that I gueſs was called by <hi>Pauſanias, Thermodon:</hi> which he ſaith, paſſed by the Mountain <hi>Hypatus,</hi> lying towards the River <hi>Cephiſus,</hi> part of which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing formerly through the <hi>Theban</hi> Lake, came this way, taking <hi>Thermodon</hi> along with it about two hours riding off the right hand.</p>
               <p>The next day early we parted from <hi>Thebes,</hi> and came to <hi>Livadia</hi> in the Evening, by the ſame way we had done before to <hi>Thebes</hi> from <hi>Liva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> when we firſt came into <hi>Greece.</hi> The next day we parted from <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vadia</hi> Northward: and about an hour after paſſed the River, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid, riſeth between Mount <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> and <hi>Cirphis,</hi> and runs this way,<note place="margin">TRITON <hi>fl.</hi>
                  </note> being probably that which is by <hi>Strabo</hi> called <hi>Triton.</hi> Hard by this place it joineth with another Stream coming from <hi>Livadia,</hi> which was called <hi>Hercyna.</hi> After this we went over a ſmall Mountain, which I gueſs to be that <hi>Strabo</hi> calls <hi>Acontium,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ACONTIUM.</note> for it ſeems to be a Ridge derived from Mount <hi>Parnaſſus.</hi> From <hi>Acontium</hi> we deſcended into a large Plain, where
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:95495:200"/>we paſſed three Rivers; and after five or ſix hours riding from <hi>Livadia</hi> we came to <hi>Turco-chorio.</hi>

                  </note> The firſt of thoſe three Rivers is pretty large and deep, being called <hi>Maronero,</hi> or <hi>Black-water:</hi> whence it is eaſie to gueſs it is the ſame that in times paſt was called <hi>Melas,</hi> which ſignifies the ſame thing, that is, <hi>Black:</hi> and agrees very well with the ſituation <hi>Strabo</hi> gives it; to wit, that it deſcendeth from the Mountains of <hi>Phocis,</hi> as this doth.<note place="margin">CHARA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DRUS <hi>fl. 1.</hi>
                  </note> The third is a ſmall ſtream, and may well enough be thought that, he calleth <hi>Charadrus,</hi> which falleth into the <hi>Cephiſus;</hi> undoubtedly the laſt of theſe Rivers, having a large and deep ſtream watering the Plain in its courſe Weſtwards, running between <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> South, and <hi>Oeta Mons</hi> North: From whoſe Ridges where they meet bearing North-Weſtwards from <hi>Turcochorio,</hi>

It hath the high Mountains of <hi>Olta,</hi> and the <hi>Thermopylae,</hi> about two hours riding North: and thoſe of <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> as much to the South. The higheſt Point of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſus</hi> is ſeen hence South by Weſt, and is called now <hi>Heliocoro,</hi> or as my Camerade ſaith, <hi>Lycoura:</hi> I rather believe it <hi>Heliocoro,</hi> as it was told me from an obſervation I made at <hi>Turco-chorio;</hi> which was this. I roſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was light the next Morning after our coming thither, and walking out I obſerved, that the Sun ſhined on the Snow, which lay upon the top of the Mountain, a good while before it was broad-day light in the Plain. But either one or the other may be but a corruption of the more ancient and true name <hi>Lycorea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Kan,</hi> where we Lodged, were many ancient Pillars and Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Antiquity, as alſo about the Village: ſo that it is probable, the place was conſiderable in times paſt, though now it be reduced to almoſt nothing. The nearneſs to the River, which I ſuppoſe to be the <hi>Cephiſus,</hi> makes me believe it was ſome Town of the <hi>Locri Epicnemides,</hi> to which and <hi>Phocis</hi> that River was the ancient bounds.</p>
               <p>This was the unlucky place, where we received News, that the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were ſo covered with Snow that they were unpaſſable, and might continue ſo for a Month, or ſix Weeks longer: Which made my Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade make a ſudden reſolution to ſtay no longer for the Weather; but to return with all the ſpeed he could make by <hi>Zant</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> into his own Country: which reſolution of his I could no ways hinder by all the reaſons I could give him to the contrary. Indeed to ſtay there, at ſuch a miſerable place, was neither convenient nor agreeable. But we might, in the mean time, have gone and ſeen ſome other places of the Adjacent Countries, not unworthy our pains, and that not far out of our way; for as I then believed, and afterwards found to be true, we might have paſſed another way, more to the Sea-ſide, and under the Mountains. For my ſelf, I muſt confeſs, I could not ſo ſoon be reconciled to the Sea, in ſuch bad weather, and that Seaſon of the Year, to comply with him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, therefore though with a great deal of unwillingneſs, after a few days ſtaying there, we parted from <hi>Turco-chorio</hi> different wayes. He, with <hi>Morates</hi> our <hi>Druggerman,</hi> paſſing by <hi>Dalia,</hi> a Town at the foot of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> on the North-Eaſtſide of it, about five or ſix Miles from <hi>Liva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> (where the Fountain of <hi>Melas,</hi> or the River <hi>Maronero</hi> riſeth; and
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:95495:200"/>from thence by <hi>Diſtomo</hi> to <hi>Aſproſpiti,</hi> where he Embarqued for <hi>Zant</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> and from thence returned home to <hi>Lyons:</hi> I, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, going towards <hi>Thalanda,</hi> and the Mouth of the River <hi>Cephiſus,</hi> with a reſolution, after I had more particularly informed my ſelf of <hi>Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otia,</hi> to return again to <hi>Athens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thurſday</hi> the ninth of <hi>March,</hi> being thus ſeparated from my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I left <hi>Turco-chorio,</hi> bending my courſe Eaſtwards, to go to <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landa.</hi> The firſt thing that diverted me in that ſolitary condition was, that I ſoon found my ſelf on a long ſtreight way, fortified with a deep Ditch on each ſide, leading to certain Hills, which I ſaw a good way off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me. This I took as a good <hi>Omen,</hi> portending ſucceſs to my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, it ſeeming to admoniſh me, that I ſhould not fail to be guarded by Gods good Providence, ſo long as I travelled in <hi>the ſtreight way of Virtue</hi> and <hi>true Piety,</hi> to my Heavenly Country, <hi>which is on high.</hi> This way is raiſed high, ſeeming to have been anciently paved, about ten or a dozen Yards broad, and was moſt probably in times paſt a Roman <hi>Via Foſſa.</hi> I continued on it about an hour and half, until I came to the foot of the Hill, that lay directly before us. Here the way ending, we ſaw the Ruins of an old Town, with a little Caſtle belonging to it, ſeated upon a Rock. Afterwards, aſcending the Hill, near the top of it, we ſaw ſome old ruinous Churches, and about two hours further riding, we came by Noon to a Village called <hi>Calopodia.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">CALOPO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIA.</note> The top of this Hill is well cultivated, and planted with Vineyards, eſpecially near about the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage: But we found no good Wine there; although the good Woman, whoſe Houſe we alighted at, was at that time Viſited by a near Relation of hers, who ſtayed to dine with her. The Cheer ſhe made her Friend, was indeed no more than mean; but the Welcome ſhe expreſſed was very grateful, hearty, and Chriſtian-like; and the chief Ceremony of Civility, which ſhe uſed towards her Relation at Dinner was this; when we were ſet down, having baked her Bread upon the Hearth, ſhe brought it whole as it was, and preſents it to her Gueſt: who received it, kiſſing her hands, and then breaking it, reſtored it her again to be diſtributed about the Table. We met with no occaſion here to ſtay us long after Dinner: So being quickly again on our way, as we paſſed out of Town, we obſerv'd many Ruins and ancient Foundations of Buildings on our right hand; particularly of a Temple built of white Marble; the Pillars whereof were Channel'd: but of what Order they were we could not find. We continued yet about three hours upon the ſame Mountain, up-hill and down-hill, till we came at length to the brow of it: which gave us the proſpect of the Iſle <hi>Euboea,</hi> the Sea, and of a fair Plain, ſtretched out a great length to the North-Weſt and South-Eaſt; and is in breadth to the Seawards at leaſt half a dozen Miles. The Sea here maketh a large Gulf between the firm Land and the Iſland; it being the Sea of <hi>Locris,</hi> as may eaſily be gathered out of <hi>Strabo:</hi> and the moſt Northern Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of <hi>Euboea</hi> appearing from thence, as lying North-North-Eaſt. This Plain ſhould be well tilled and peopled, from the many Villages which from this proſpect appear ſtrewed up and down upon it.<note place="margin">CNEMIS <hi>Mons.</hi>
                  </note> The more Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern part of this Mountain ſhould be Mount <hi>Cnemis;</hi> from whence the <hi>Locri</hi> of this Country were called <hi>Locri Epicnemides:</hi> But the Southern ſide of it, which ſeems to be but a Ridge of the greater Mountain, and
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:95495:201"/>runneth along between the Lake of <hi>Libadia,</hi> this Plain, and the Sea; is more likely hereabouts to have been called <hi>Cirtonum mons.</hi>

                  </note> Hence alſo, beyond this Gulph Northwards, a great way off I diſcovered vaſt high Mountains, cover'd with Snow: which I took to be the famous <hi>Olympus</hi> of <hi>Theſſaly.</hi> Deſcending this Hill into the Plain, there is a little ſtream coming out of it, which to me ſeems to be the ancient River <hi>Platanius,</hi> which of old ſeparated <hi>Boeotia</hi> from <hi>Locris,</hi> at the Town <hi>Hala,</hi> as <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanias</hi> affirmeth, and <hi>Strabo</hi> ſeems to intimate: where after having ſpoken of <hi>Anthidon,</hi> the laſt Town of <hi>Boeotia</hi> on that ſhore, as <hi>Homer</hi> makes it, he ſays, that nevertheleſs going further, there are two other Towns, <hi>viz. Larimna,</hi> by which the River <hi>Cephiſus</hi> runneth into the Sea; and going yet further this <hi>Hala,</hi> bearing the ſame name with thoſe of <hi>Attica.</hi> The place is corrupted, as the Learned <hi>Caſaeubon</hi> obſerv'd, but I wonder he did not obſerve where the miſtake lay. For the Copiſts have written <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, as is evident out of <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> and the very place it ſelf. For <hi>Strabo,</hi> having before ſpoken of two Towns, whereof <hi>Larimna</hi> was one, why ſhould he put <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>Being deſcended into the Plain, we kept the Mountain on our right hand, and in about half an hours riding more, we came to a Town ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated on the brow of it,<note place="margin">THALANDA.</note> called <hi>Thalanda.</hi> This is yet a large Town, and hath been incomparably greater in ancient times, as the Ruins for about a Mile out of Town, and the many old Churches and Towers that ſtand far above it on the Hill, do manifeſt. It is much too big, to be taken for the Village <hi>Hala,</hi> that <hi>Pauſanias</hi> places on the right hand of the River <hi>Platanius</hi> upon the Sea ſhore; bearing the face of the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> City of a Country: which if I underſtand <hi>Strabo</hi> aright, can be no other than that famous City <hi>Opus</hi> of the ancients, which gave name to the Country, and Sea before it;<note place="margin">LOCRI OPUNTII.

               <p>This Town may contain five or ſix thouſand Souls, of Greeks, Jews and Turks, and is a Biſhoprick ſubject to the See of <hi>Athens.</hi> My Guide being alone with me, was ſo timerous here, that he would not go up
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:95495:201"/>and down the Town, as in other places we had uſed to do, for fear we ſhould be taken for Spies: So that, as to what particulars of Antiquity remain here, and might have been obſerv'd by us, had we uſed our won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted liberty, I can at preſent give no account. We parted hence the next Morning Eaſtwards ſtill under the Hill; The Plain growing now more and more narrow, between the Sea and the Mountains; in which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it held us about two hours riding, until we came to a little Bay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which there runneth five or ſix large Streams. They run from under the Mountain hard by; and turn four Mills under the Wheels, not full thirty Yards from their Sources: They come out from the Lake of <hi>Liva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> hard by the Town of <hi>Polea,</hi> which is on the other ſide of this Hill, by the Lake, as I was afterwards informed. From thence our way, lying South-Eaſtwards, was rough, up-hill and down-hill, until about Noon we came to a Town called <hi>Proſcina</hi> upon the ſame Hill.<note place="margin">PROSCINA.</note> This Town con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of about an hundred Houſes of Chriſtians for the moſt part; and ſeems an ancient place, being very probably that, which in <hi>Strabo's</hi> and <hi>Pauſanias</hi> his time was called <hi>Acraephium,</hi> or <hi>Acraephnium,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ACR AEPH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIUM.</note> which was ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated upon the Mountain <hi>Ptoos.</hi> After Dinner we mounted again up higher, according as our Road lay, over a well-cultivated Country on the Hills: which I doubt not, but in old time made the Plain of <hi>Athamas:</hi> nor can the Wooded Hills above them, be thought to want chace more now than they did of old. After three hours riding from <hi>Proſcina</hi> we came to the other ſide of the Hill; to many of the Subterraneous Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Lake of <hi>Livadia</hi> into the Sea;<note place="margin">KATABA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THRA.</note> which they call <hi>Katabathra</hi> and <hi>Catabathos:</hi> our way hither lying ſtill South.</p>
               <p>Theſe Subterraneous, or rather Submontaneous Paſſages of the Water, may very well be reckoned amongſt the greateſt Wonders of the World; to accompliſh which, both Art and Nature ſeem to have been ſo indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious, that it is hard to determine unto which of them we ought to give the glory of the work. For here Art ſeems to excel nature; and yet the greatneſs of the work is ſuch, that it ſeems no leſs apparently to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell the power of human induſtry. Therefore ſince our Modern Writers are upon this matter wholly ſilent, and from the ancients ſo ſlender an account of it is come down to us as is altogether unintelligible; I ſhall be the more particular in my Obſervations of it, and ſhall give the beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it I can.</p>
               <p>Which that I may do to be the better underſtood, I ſhall firſt give an account of the ſituation of the Lake, and the Plain in which it is <hi>ſtagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> and then of the ſeveral Paſſages out of the Water of the Lake into the <hi>Euboean</hi> Sea.</p>
               <p>This Lake is now called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Lake of <hi>Livadia,</hi> but by <hi>Strabo Copais,</hi> and by <hi>Pauſanias Cephiſſis.</hi> It is ſituate on the North-ſide of that large Plain, which is call'd by the ſame name of <hi>Livadia,</hi> which is ſtretched out between the Plain of <hi>Thebes</hi> and the Town <hi>Liva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia:</hi> the whole <hi>Perimeter</hi> of which Country and Lake is ſo encompaſſed with high Hills and Mountains, ſo joined one to another, that there is not ſo much as ſpace for the many ſtreams and torrents that ariſe under, and fall from them to paſs out above ground into the Sea: So that had not the Wiſdom of the Creator provided at ſeveral places certain ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous Paſſages, as Chanels to receive and ſuck in the Waters, which in
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:95495:202"/>ſo great abundance, at times, do flow and pour down theſe Mountains, and were not thoſe Chanels either by nature, or art, and induſtry of men kept open and cleanſed, all <hi>Boeotia</hi> muſt neceſſarily in a ſhort ſpace of time be drowned, and made nothing but a great Lake, or ſtanding Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For beginning firſt at <hi>Parnes,</hi> that Mountain is join'd to <hi>Cithaeron, Cithaeron</hi> is join'd to <hi>Helicon, Helicon</hi> to <hi>Parnaſſus, Parnaſſus</hi> to Mount <hi>Oeta,</hi> that to <hi>Cnemis, Cnemis</hi> to the <hi>Cyrtonum Mons,</hi> That to <hi>Ptoos, Ptoos</hi> to <hi>Meſſapius, Meſſapius</hi> to <hi>Cerycius,</hi> and that again to <hi>Parnes:</hi> Which Mountains, although all, or moſt of them be well enough diſtinguiſhed from each other by certain <hi>Chaſms</hi> or <hi>Openings</hi> between them, yet are they all ſo tacked and link'd together by <hi>High-Grounds,</hi> that before the Waters could find Paſſage any way into the Sea above ground, the whole Country below them muſt unavoidably be drowned: which perhaps was one great reaſon of <hi>Deucalions</hi> Flood, in which theſe parts ſeem chiefly concerned.</p>
               <p>But beſide this Circle of Mountains that encompaſs all <hi>Boeotia, Phocis,</hi> and great part of <hi>Locris,</hi> there are other Mediterranean Mountains alſo, which are tacked to one another in ſuch ſort that they divide the whole Country into ſeveral particular Vallies; which from a high proſpect look as if they were thoſe places in the Earth, the Gyants laid open when in their War with the Gods they plucked up Mountains by the Roots, and ſet them upon one another, intending to ſcale Heaven thereby. For ſo is this Plain of <hi>Livadia</hi> divided from that of <hi>Thebes,</hi> Eaſtward by the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Phoenicius,</hi> or <hi>Sphingis;</hi> which joins Northwards to the Mountain <hi>Ptoos,</hi> Southwards to certain Ridges which deſcend from <hi>Helicon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From thoſe high Mountains, <hi>Helicon</hi> South-Weſt, <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> and <hi>Oeta</hi> North-Weſt, are poured down thoſe quantities of Waters into this Plain; which <hi>ſtagnating,</hi> make the great Lake of <hi>Livadia,</hi> by falling towards the Ridge of the Rocky Hills of <hi>Thalanda</hi> or <hi>Cyrtonum Mons;</hi> againſt which the whole ſtreſs and fall of the Waters ſeems to lean; but are by them, as by a mighty Mound or Bank, kept in from diſcharging themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Euboean</hi> Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Strabo</hi> counts this Lake no leſs than three hundred ſeventy one <hi>Stadia</hi> in Circumference; which amounts to about forty ſeven Miles and a half. But I believe it covers not ſo much ground at preſent. For then, in his time, it had one paſſage out above ground, into <hi>Hylica palus,</hi> now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Theban Lake:</hi> But now the Waters are far lower than that Paſſage; and therefore are to be thought very much abated. The form of this Lake is long, being ſtretched out under the Mountains of <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landa,</hi> or <hi>Cyrtonum Mons,</hi> North-Weſt and South-Eaſt, as far as the Mountain <hi>Ptoos.</hi> In the middle it is narrow, but then enlarging it ſelf again until it comes to be divided at the South-Eaſt end, into three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Bayes: At the two Northmoſt of theſe Bays are the principal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, in a wonderful manner pierced through the Mountains: The whole maſs whereof conſiſts of a very hard ſtone, conſiderably high and of a great extent in thickneſs, though in ſome places it be greater, and in others leſs; the ſhorteſt Paſſage to the Sea being towards <hi>Thalanda,</hi> and the North-Weſt end of the Lake is at leaſt four Miles through the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Where this enters in, under the Mountain, is a Town called <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lea,</hi> ſituate towards the North-Weſt end of the Lake: where it riſeth
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:95495:202"/>again on the other ſide near the Sea, are thoſe Mills I but now ſpake of, about two hours riding from <hi>Thalanda.</hi> This ſeems to be the place, which <hi>Strabo</hi> calls <hi>Anchoe,</hi> where the Town of <hi>Copais</hi> was alſo ſituated; that gave the old name to this Lake: and by the ſame rule on the Sea ſide, where the Waters come out of the Lake, ſhould lye <hi>Larimna Superior,</hi> or that of <hi>Locris:</hi> where <hi>Strabo</hi> makes the Chanels to paſs thirty <hi>Stadia,</hi> or about four Miles, under ground from <hi>Copais</hi> to <hi>Larimna.</hi> The other Chanels I ſaw on the North-Weſt end of the Lake, are all a much greater diſtance from the Sea, many of them paſſing at leaſt half a days Journey under the Mountain <hi>Ptoos.</hi> The Northmoſt of the two Bayes laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, divides it ſelf again into three Bayes: the firſt of which entreth under the Mountain by two Chanels: the ſecond and third by three Chanels apiece. Another Bay alſo there is, that divideth it ſelf into many other little Bays, and thoſe again into Chanels: Inſomuch that I eaſily believe what an <hi>Albaneſe,</hi> I met there, told me; to wit, that there were at leaſt fifty of theſe under-ground Chanels, whereby the Lake emptieth it ſelf into the Sea. For I ſaw above half the number of them my ſelf. From <hi>Proſcina</hi> hither, a conſiderable part of our way lay along one of thoſe Chanels, in ſeveral places of which we ſaw holes down to it; but could neither ſee nor hear the Water, as it paſſed, by reaſon the Chanel was every where cloſe covered, and much deeper. When we came to aſcend the ſteeper part of the Mountain, we paſſed by ten or a dozen ſquare Stone-Pits about a Furlong diſtant one from another; which I found ſtill deeper and deeper according to the riſing of the Mountain; until by the ſound of the Stones I caſt in, I could not judge them leſs than fifty Fathom deep; but I heard no ſound of Water at the bottom: The reaſon whereof I found becauſe the Chanel, which carries the Water, lyeth covered deeper under them. They are about four foot ſquare a piece at the Mouth, and cut out of the hard Rock of the Mountain. From all which I began to be ſenſible of the vaſt labour, coſt, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable induſtry, that brought the whole work to ſuch perfection. For by ſuch Pits as theſe the reſt of the fifty Chanels were firſt made, if made at all, and are now upon occaſion cleanſed, when ever they happen to be obſtructed. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſaith, that the ancients believed that <hi>Hercules</hi> made this Lake by turning the River <hi>Cephiſus</hi> into the Plain of the <hi>Orcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meni;</hi> whereas before his time it paſt into the Sea by Chanels under the Mountains: I rather believe, that <hi>Hercules</hi> ſtopped the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Paſſage under the Mountain; which the <hi>Orchomeni</hi> opened again after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; for that in <hi>Pauſanias</hi> his own opinion ſeems very unlikely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Orchomeni,</hi> in the time of the Trojan Wars were the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and rich of all thoſe parts of <hi>Greece.</hi> But to me it ſeems altogether impoſſible, for ſuppoſing the <hi>Cephiſus</hi> had another way under ground than where the Lake ſtands, which to me is no way probable. Yet there are abundance of other ſtreams falling from the <hi>Helicon</hi> and <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> ſufficient to make this Lake, and drown the Country without that. But how ever this was, I am ſure the greatneſs and difficulty of the work was ſuch, that there was more need of an Army of <hi>Hercules</hi>'s to have done it, than of one ſingle perſon to ſpoil it. But by aid of which of the Gods, or by what mean it was perform'd I find not. I have ſeen none of the <hi>Roman</hi> Works greater, nor any thing in nature or art more worthy of admiration.</p>
               <pb n="468" facs="tcp:95495:203"/>
               <p>From the Northmoſt of theſe Bayes, where this Chanel entreth into the Mountain, I obſerved, that the higheſt point of <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> lay Weſt-North-Weſt: Some part of the <hi>Helicon,</hi> not covered by the Mountain <hi>Phoenicius</hi> or <hi>Sphingis,</hi> Weſt.</p>
               <p>South, and South-Weſtward of theſe two Bayes, about ſix or ſeven Miles diſtant, there is another Bay of the Lake divided from theſe by a Ridge or Promontory, running out from the Mountain <hi>Ptoos:</hi> which Ridge is now called <hi>Cocino,</hi> from a Town on it of the ſame name. Near, or at the end of this Bay, the Mountain, which the ancients ſeem to call <hi>Phoenicius,</hi> or <hi>Sphingis,</hi> is joined to that of <hi>Cocino,</hi> only there is one narrow ſlit between them; which I judge can be no other than that only Paſſage of the Lake <hi>above ground</hi> into the <hi>Hylica palus,</hi> mention'd by <hi>Strabo Lib. IX.</hi> But at preſent no Water paſſeth that way above ground; nor, as I could perceive, under ground: yet there hath been an old Chanel under this gap, that is tumbled in, and now, as far as I could gueſs, quite ſtopped up. This Gap, or Paſſage, was alſo cut thorough the hard Rock, for a Mile or two, to bring it to the <hi>Theban</hi> Lake: which without doubt was the ſame with <hi>Hylica palus</hi> of the Ancients: of which I will next give an account in its due place.</p>
               <p>From theſe <hi>Catabathra,</hi> as they call them, or Chanels under-ground, we were conducted about three or four Miles South-Weſtwards, up to the Village <hi>Cocino,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">COCINO.</note> on the Ridge of the Mountain that bears the ſame name. Hard by it I was ſhewed ſome ruined Churches, with two or three old Towns lying in the ſame condition; among the ruins whereof were ſome few pieces of Antiquity. Paſſing between theſe ruins and <hi>Cocino,</hi> I obſerv'd a Spring in the Mountain that waters the whole Town. The Inhabitants of this Village are all <hi>Albaneſes;</hi> and, I believe I bely them not, the whole place little better than a Neſt of Thieves, of which our Landlord was the Chief. For at Midnight there was Intelligence brought him by ſome of his Gang, that they had ſtollen a Horſe, deſiring his advice how to diſpoſe of it; which our Guide underſtanding, gave us notice thereof, wiſhing us to ſtand on our Guard: which we did, keeping our Carabins cloſe to our ſides: But our Guide, I believe, had made them well nigh as much afraid of us, as we were of them. For our Hoſt having been very inquiſitive to know of him who I was, he made him believe (as theſe <hi>Greeks</hi> never want invention to help themſelves out at a dead lift) that I was <hi>Scrivan,</hi> or Secretary to the <hi>Captain Baſha</hi> of the <hi>Negropont.</hi> As to the ancient name of this place I can find no traces in ancient Authors to inform me.</p>
               <p>The next Morning we parted from thence early, and turning about the ſide of the Mountain, whoſe top we always kept at our right hand, in half in hours time we came to a narrow Paſſage between the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Ptoos,</hi> and this Ridge of it now called <hi>Cocino;</hi> which gave us a fair proſpect over the Lake of <hi>Thebes:</hi> which ſo ſoon as I ſaw, I alighted off my Horſe, and climb'd up to the higheſt point of <hi>Cocino,</hi> to take the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proſpect of it, and <hi>Copais Lacus</hi> together; finding them ſo near to each other: which although it coſt me no ſmall quantity of the ſweat of my Brows; yet I found it well worth my pains. For it gave me not only the proſpect of both the Lakes together, but of much of the Country about them. I found the <hi>Catabathra</hi> on the other ſide of the Mountain,
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:95495:203"/>North off me, and the <hi>Theban</hi> Lake on the oppoſite ſide South. The higheſt point of the Mountain over <hi>Thalanda,</hi> North-Weſt by Weſt; of <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> Weſt-North-Weſt. The beginning of <hi>Helicon,</hi> now called <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara,</hi> Weſt; where it joins with <hi>Cithaeron</hi> South-Weſt. Thence South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards join <hi>Cithaeron</hi> and <hi>Parnes;</hi> which divide <hi>Attica</hi> from <hi>Boeotia.</hi> Hence I took the Scheme of both the Lakes as I have given you them in the Map. Of <hi>Copais</hi> I have already ſpoken: But of this of <hi>Thebes,</hi> or <hi>Hylica Palus,</hi> I ſhall now give you the Deſcription.</p>
               <p>This Lake is now called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>Theban</hi> Lake;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> Thebane <hi>Lake</hi> Hylica Palus.</note> but anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently <hi>Hylica palus.</hi> It is much leſs than that of <hi>Copais,</hi> and is incloſed with Mountains round about it. It is diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Copais</hi> North, by the Mountain <hi>Cocino,</hi> and Weſt by the Mountain <hi>Phoenicius,</hi> or <hi>Sphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis:</hi> between which two it had formerly Communication with <hi>Copais,</hi> as I before ſaid, but now I could find none. The Mountain <hi>Ptoos</hi> lyeth North-Eaſt of it; Mount <hi>Hypatus</hi> between it and <hi>Thebes</hi> South, and South-Eaſt: between which it findeth its way into the Sea, Northward of the <hi>Euripus:</hi> But whether wholly above-ground, I am not able to determine. From this Hill it ſeems like the leaf of ſome Plant; whereof its ſeveral Bayes are the diviſions of the leaf, and the Chanel that runs Eaſtward out of it, looks like the ſtem. It ſeems not more long than large, and is about four or five Miles over. Great part of the Lake was then covered with all ſorts of Wild-Fowl, and they ſay 'tis full of Fiſh: notwithſtanding they tell a ſtory, that every thirtieth or one and thirti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Year it is quite dried up: From what hath been ſaid, thoſe that have good skill in the Greek Tongue, may be able to underſtand that very defective place in <hi>Strabo,</hi> where he ſpeaks of theſe two Lakes, and reſtore it again.</p>
               <p>When I returned again down the Mountain to my Guide, I found my <hi>Caravochero</hi> almoſt in deſpair of my returning again ſafe to him, fearing I had been ſet upon by ſome of the <hi>Albaneſes</hi> of the Mountains. But thanks be to God it was otherwiſe: Deſcending therefore together from that paſſage, yet ſomewhat lower, we came to the Ruins of a Town, hear unto which, on the ſide of the Hill we obſerved a curious Fountain, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning down thence into the <hi>Thebane</hi> Lake. This Town might be the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Hyla,</hi> which gave name to the Lake.<note place="margin">HYLA.</note> Here alſo I found ſome frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Inſcriptions; but ſuch as gave me no hint of the ancient name of it: Deſcending yet lower down the Mountain, towards the Lake, leaving the way to <hi>Thebes</hi> on the left hand, and turning under the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Cocino,</hi> which we kept at our right, we came in leſs than an hour to a ſmall Village called <hi>Hungaro,</hi> juſt by the old Paſſage of <hi>Cephiſus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">HUNGARO.</note> into the <hi>Hylica palus,</hi> according to <hi>Strabo:</hi> When I had made all my Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of it, according to what I have before ſaid, by a very ill way Southwards we mounted up the Hill, now called <hi>Mazaraci,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">MAZARACI.</note> from a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery that is on it of like name. This is that Hill, or Mountain, which <hi>Strabo</hi> deſcribes by the name <hi>Phoenicius,</hi> and <hi>Pauſanias</hi> by the name of <hi>Sphingis mons.</hi> On the top of it is a good large Plain which lyeth deſart; rather, as I judge, for want of Cultivation than of fertility. Thence after Dinner, and an hours further riding, we deſcended by the Covent <hi>Mazaraci</hi> into the Plain of <hi>Thebes,</hi> leaving a ruined Village about a Mile Eaſtward of <hi>Mazaraci.</hi> We might ſoon have croſſed over this end of
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:95495:204"/>the Plain, it being narrow, had not the Water after the Rains ſetled there, and made the ground ſo falſe and rotten, that we feared almoſt every ſtep to be ſwallowed up both Horſe and Man together; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent which we went afoot our ſelves. But having, by Gods help, eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that danger, and croſſed the way from <hi>Thebes</hi> to <hi>Livadia,</hi> we aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded again another Hill, bounding the Plain of <hi>Thebes,</hi> from the Plain of <hi>Rimocaſtri</hi> Southwards, and came to <hi>Rimocaſtri</hi> on the other ſide of it, an hour before Night.</p>
               <p>I made a ſtop on the top of this Hill,<note place="margin">RIMOCA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STRI.</note> and ſurveighed the Country about me. For thence I had the ſight of a great part of <hi>Boeotia,</hi> that I had not before ſeen: eſpecially the Plain of <hi>Rimocaſtri.</hi> But thoſe parts I left behind, I obſerved to lie thus. The Mountain by <hi>Thalanda</hi> North North-Weſt. The Paſſage between the Mountains from <hi>Cocino</hi> and the reſt of <hi>Ptoos,</hi> North-Eaſt by North. A Mountain towards <hi>Egripo,</hi> I think <hi>Typo-Vouni,</hi> Eaſt-North-Eaſt. <hi>Chaſha,</hi> or <hi>Parnes,</hi> Eaſt-South-Eaſt. <hi>Elatea,</hi> or <hi>Cithaeron,</hi> beginneth South-Eaſt, and deſcendeth ſomewhat upon the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Gulph; to wit on the Bay of that Gulph, called now <hi>Liva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſtro,</hi> South, South-Weſt. Whence ariſeth a high Rock, off from it, and <hi>Helicon</hi> Weſt, South-Weſt. The top of the <hi>Helicon</hi> appears hence, Weſt by North, being the neareſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rimocaſtri</hi> is ſituated upon the Brow of this Hill, over-looking a large Plain South, and hath an unlimited proſpect towards the <hi>Morea,</hi> between <hi>Helicon</hi> and <hi>Cithaeron.</hi> It is divided into three little knots of Houſes, two upon the Hill, and one below: which may in all conſiſt of about a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Cottages of <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Albaneſes:</hi> all Chriſtians except a <hi>Sub-Baſha</hi> that governs them, who is a <hi>Turk.</hi> That part of the Town which ſtands upon the point of the Brow, ſeemeth to have been in former times forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with a Ditch on the North-ſide: on the other, the Precipice of the Hill is its defence; though at preſent needleſs: their Poverty being ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity enough for them. Here it is that I drank the beſt Wine, the moſt generous and well taſted that I had done in all <hi>Greece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Plain are many ancient Ruins of Towns, and about this place, and juſt under the Mountain, are ſo many and great Ruins, that it hath made ſome to ſuppoſe this place to have been the ancient <hi>Theſpia:</hi> But I am not of their opinion. I think rather it was the ancient <hi>Thisba,</hi> as I ſhall have occaſion by and by again more expreſly to conclude, ſhewing by moſt probable Teſtimony, where the old <hi>Theſpia</hi> was. Here I met with <hi>Morat</hi> our Druggerman; who brought me news, that he had ſeen my Companion ſafely Embarked. Whereupon taking Horſe the next day I made a Circuit about the Plain, bending my courſe Weſtwards, under the Hill; and after about a Mile we came to ſome Ruins, and old decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches,<note place="margin">PHRIA.</note> called <hi>Phria:</hi> where we alſo found ſome Inſcriptions; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially one, which was a Pedeſtal, dedicated by the Town to one <hi>Titus Flavius Ariſtus.</hi> About a Mile further riding, we came to another ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Town called <hi>Spatharia;</hi> the Church whereof, ruinated in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with the Town, ſeem'd to have been built at firſt of ancient, ill car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Marbles, with <hi>Baſſo-relievoes</hi> of the ſame, of men on Horſe-back, with their names, and
ΗΡΩΗ
for title to each one of them. Thence turning more South-Weſtwards, we paſſed over by a Stone-Bridge, a River coming from the <hi>Helicon,</hi> and running Eaſtwards in this Plain, and
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:95495:204"/>about two Miles further came to a Village called <hi>Neocoria,</hi> or <hi>New-town;</hi> juſt at the foot of the Mountain <hi>Zagara,</hi> or <hi>Helicon:</hi> hard by which are the Ruins of an ancient City, upon a Hill, with a ſteep deſcent from it every way except on that ſide where it is joined to the high Mountain above it. In the way going up to it is a ruined Church; which hath for the <hi>Altar</hi> a Corniſh of a Pedeſtal of a Statue, about four foot long, and three foot large, and a foot thick: on the edge of which is an ancient Inſcription, wherein the Town <hi>Theſpia</hi> is twice mentioned.</p>

                  <note place="margin">THESPIA.</note> It is about four Miles diſtant from <hi>Rimocaſtri</hi> Weſtwards, and five or ſix from <hi>Cacos,</hi> a Town ſeated in one of the Bayes of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Gulph, called now <hi>Livadoſtro.</hi> Thence we turned South-Eaſt-wards, and after two or three Miles riding over a little Hill, we came to other Ruins of a Town called <hi>Palaeo-corio,</hi> or <hi>Old Town;</hi> where we likewiſe found ſome Inſcriptions, but leſs conſiderable.</p>
               <p>Thence returning Eaſtwards we paſſed by another little Village called <hi>Tadza,</hi> where are ſome marks of Antiquity; and by it a curious Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which I gueſs to be that which was ſo celebrated in old times for the Fable of <hi>Narciſſus:</hi> and if ſo, the Town ſhould have been called <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pauſ.</hi> Lib. 3. p. 589.</note> or <hi>Hedonacon</hi> as ſome read it. I ſaw no <hi>Narciſſus</hi> then growing, it being yet too early in the Year. But another time I ſaw abundance in the next Plain, and ſeveral other places adjacent. Yet what <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſaith of this Fountain agreeth with ſeveral other places in this Plain; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially <hi>Rimocaſtri;</hi> where there are many Springs up and down the Plain: which collecting themſelves into ſtreams, ſome run towards the <hi>Theban</hi> Lake, and others to the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Gulph. That which runs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Thebes, ſtagnates</hi> into a Lake, Eaſtwards of <hi>Rimocaſtri,</hi> as I ſaw at two or three Miles diſtance. We returned by the Ruins under <hi>Rimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtri,</hi> which they call now only <hi>Castri,</hi> where there are many Ruined Churches, with Fragments of Inſcriptions about them. Amongſt which I found a Stone in the Wall, where I read
ΠΡΑΞΙΤΙΛΗΣ ΑΘΗΝΑ,
which whether it was belonging to ſome piece of that famous Sculpture, I will not take upon me to know. Only this I can ſay, that <hi>Pauſanias</hi> gives an account of an Image of <hi>Cupid,</hi> of his work, adored and much admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the <hi>Theſpians:</hi> in whoſe Territories not only this place was, but alſo the whole Plain. As to the ancient names of this, and the reſt of the Ruined Towns I ſaw there, I found not ſufficient ground for me to determine any thing here; yet by <hi>Pauſanias</hi> his Deſcription, this ſhould be <hi>Thisba</hi> of the ancients; which he placeth off from the Sea,<note place="margin">THISEA.</note> after two Mountains in a Vally. For ſo many Hills, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> often magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied into Mountains, are between it and the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Gulph, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe two Hills another ſmall Plain.</p>
               <p>When I had thus far croſſed the Country, I had a great mind to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:95495:205"/>ſtill forward, until I came to the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Gulph, that I might have a fuller <hi>Idaea</hi> of it. But I had much ado to perſwade my Drugger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to it: who pretended it to be dangerous by reaſon of Thieves and Pirates. But by means of a Dollar extraordinary I accompliſhed my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and perſwaded our Hoſt to accompany us alſo. We paſſed over the Plain of <hi>Rimocaſtri</hi> South-Weſtwards, and mounted a Hill, which ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates it from another little Plain, bounded by Mount <hi>Cithaeron.</hi> From this Plain we yet further deſcended along the <hi>Cithaeron,</hi> by a bad way Weſtwards to the Bay of <hi>Livadoſtro;</hi> along by a ſtream, which often loſeth it ſelf among the Sand and Stones in its Chanel, before it can get to the Sea. There is no Town, nor Inhabitants there; only an old Tower, and a little Church for the Mariners to do their Devotions in, who come thither to lade Corn for <hi>Zant, Cephalonia,</hi> and thoſe other parts. In our way we firſt paſſed by a little Village called <hi>Sta dendra,</hi> or <hi>The Trees;</hi> and then another called <hi>Parapagia:</hi> where I found ſome Inſcriptions in an old Church, near unto a Fountaia. This place, I believe, was anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently called <hi>Leuctra.</hi> For that was in the way from <hi>Theſpia</hi> to <hi>Plataea,</hi> as this muſt needs be. This Port is in a large Bay at the end of the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> Gulph: which I find no where mention'd in the modern Maps. The reaſon of which, as I gueſs, may be ſeveral miſtakes the Interpreters and Commentators have made upon <hi>Strabo:</hi> of which I may have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſpeak ſomething, before I end this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>This Bay is divided from the Bay of <hi>Corinth</hi> by the Mountain <hi>Gera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> or <hi>Palaeo-Vouni,</hi> in the <hi>ſthmus,</hi> which running out far into the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian</hi> Gulph,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Strab.</hi> Lib. 8.380.</note> makes a Promontory, which <hi>Strabo</hi> plainly calls <hi>Olmeae Promontorium:</hi> on the Northſide of which this Bay of <hi>Livadostro</hi> lyeth, and thence goeth far inward, until it is bounded by the ſhore of <hi>Megaris</hi> firſt, and then by the ſhore of <hi>Eleutherus,</hi> whence it turneth about, and hath ſome part of the high Mountain <hi>Elatea,</hi> or <hi>Cithaeron,</hi> over-looking it North; until it comes almoſt to the Harbour of <hi>Livadoſtro.</hi> Where <hi>Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tea</hi> endeth, is another Harbour, called <hi>Santo Baſilio,</hi> from a Ruined Town two or three Miles above it: whence ariſeth another Ridge of high Rocks, but not conſiderable for height if compared with <hi>Elatea;</hi> beyond which is the Harbour of <hi>Livadoſtro:</hi> and then again riſeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very high Rock, running a good way into the Sea: Beyond which is alſo another Harbour,<note place="margin">CACOS.</note> and Town called <hi>Cacos:</hi> and thence the <hi>Helicon</hi> begins to lift up its head, till at laſt it reacheth even above the Clouds. From <hi>Livadoſtro</hi> we turned to the left hand along the ſhore, about a Mile further, and came to the Harbour of <hi>Sant Baſilio;</hi> whence the Promontory <hi>Olmea</hi> lyeth Weſt-South-Weſt, with four little Iſlands by it, called <hi>Calaniſia,</hi> or the <hi>good Iſlands.</hi> In one of them is a little Church, and a Well, as the <hi>Abbaneſes</hi> told me, full of a kind of Serpents, which are not at all venemous nor hurtful; which I believe, if they be of the ſame nature with one I found on the Sea ſhore here, <hi>viz.</hi> petrified.</p>
               <p>This Bay did not want a name among the ancients, although neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our modern Geographers, as may be collected out of <hi>Strabo</hi> his eighth and ninth Books,<note place="margin">Pag. 39, 40.</note> being by him called <hi>Alcyonum mare:</hi> which was, as he ſaid, extended from <hi>Paga,</hi> a Port Town of <hi>Megaris,</hi> in the way from <hi>Megara</hi> to <hi>Boeotia</hi> unto <hi>Creuſa,</hi> the Port-Town of the <hi>Theſpians.</hi> But I will take the Learned <hi>Caſuubons</hi> warning, which he gives in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:95495:205"/>upon this place; namely not to take it to be the ſole <hi>Alcyonuma mare.</hi> For that, as to the generality of the name, was extended much further, even to <hi>Antirrhium,</hi> or the Mouth of the Gulph of <hi>Lepanto:</hi> But, by his leave, will eſteem this to have been more peculiarly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; that being, certainly, moſt properly the <hi>Alcyonum ſinus,</hi> or <hi>mare,</hi> which extended it ſelf from <hi>Pegas</hi> to <hi>Creuſa:</hi> Which <hi>Creuſa</hi> muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly have been either where <hi>Cacos</hi> or <hi>Livadoſtro</hi> now are. I judge rather the firſt, becauſe it is nearer to <hi>Theſpia</hi> than <hi>Livadoſtro.</hi> But <hi>Liva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſtro</hi> is nearer <hi>Rimocaſtri;</hi> where I ſuppoſe the ancient <hi>Thisba</hi> was: and therefore that may be its Harbour, ſo well ſtored with Pidgeons as they ſay it was; and whence to <hi>Sicyon</hi> was a hundred and ſixty <hi>Stadia,</hi> or twenty Miles, over the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Gulph; and as he ſaith, in <hi>an oblique line:</hi> of which the high Rock between this and <hi>Cacos</hi> makes one Crook, and the <hi>Olmaea</hi> Promontory another. The Harbour of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Baſilio</hi> was, very probably, that which belonged to the ancient <hi>Typha;</hi> who valued themſelves much for being the beſt Seamen of all <hi>Boeotia.</hi> At this place we lay all Night under the ſhade of a Pine-Tree; with which the Rocks there are covered.</p>
               <p>Longer than next Morning we ſtaid not in this cold Harbour; but leaving the Hill, and way on the other ſide of it to <hi>Rimocaſtri</hi> on the left hand, we turned on the right, by the way that leads thence to <hi>Thebes,</hi> near the foot of Mount <hi>Cithaeron,</hi> now called <hi>Elatea:</hi> whoſe high Ridge we had above us ſtill on the right hand: having thus mounted at leaſt an hour, till we came about, level with the Plain of <hi>Rimocaſtri,</hi> we came at laſt to <hi>Sant Baſilio</hi> it ſelf, a Town utterly ruined not long ſince by Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. But beſide the modern <hi>Remains</hi> of it, there are Reſts alſo of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages paſt. There is an old Church, with a <hi>Cupolo</hi> ſuſtained by <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> Pillars of admirable white Marble, and curious work. Hard by it is a Well of pure Water, deep, but filled to the brim. Above this lyeth the Town, on a Hillock, higher than the reſt: which is full of Ruins alſo. Between the Town and the oppoſite Hill, North-wards, in a deep furrow runneth a conſiderable ſtream; which in ſight of the Town makes a moſt pleaſing Caſcade. This in all likely hood is the ancient <hi>Typha</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned; and thoſe beautiful Pillars of the ruin'd Church may have alſo ſerved for the Temple of <hi>Hercules</hi> at <hi>Typha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Continuing forward on our way, under the Mount <hi>Cithaeron,</hi> or <hi>Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tea,</hi> we came to another ruined City, at the foot of it, ſituate ſo, as it hath a deſcent every way from it, except towards the Mountain, South-Weſt: where the ground ſeemeth level for near a Mile, to a Village cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Cocla:</hi> but theſe Ruins are called <hi>Palaeo-castro,</hi> or <hi>Old-Caſtle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">COCLA.</note> as they call almoſt all ſuch old Ruins. On the North-Weſt ſide of it I obſerved a curious Fountain; which ſeemeth to run into that ſtream, that falleth into the Bay of <hi>Livadoſtro,</hi> by <hi>Sant Baſilio.</hi> The Foundations of the ancient Walls that remain, are of large hewen Stone, and at equal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were crowned with ſquare Towers: ſome of which are yet ſtanding. It over-looketh a large Plain Northwards, well water'd with ſtreams from the Mountains, and undoubtedly very fruitful. It hath North the Mountain <hi>Mezaraci,</hi> or <hi>Phoenicius; Rimocaſtri</hi> North-North-Weſt: A Tower and Village on the point of a Rock, over-looking the Plain of <hi>Livadia,</hi> near <hi>Zagara,</hi> or <hi>Helicon</hi> North-Weſt, that part of the
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:95495:206"/>
                  <hi>Helicon</hi> where <hi>Neocorio,</hi> or old <hi>Theſpia</hi> ſtands, North-Weſt by Weſt. The largeneſs of it ſhews it to have been a conſiderable place; and the fragments of Antiquity, that are to be ſeen all about it, to have been very ancient. It agrees with the Deſcription that the ancients give both of <hi>Hirria,</hi> called afterward <hi>Hyſſia,</hi> and <hi>Plataea;</hi> to wit, being both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Mountain <hi>Cithaeron,</hi> at the right hand of the way, that leads from <hi>Thebes</hi> into <hi>Attica, Eleutherus,</hi> and <hi>Argos</hi> upon the River <hi>Aſſopus.</hi> But as for this laſt mark, I am at a ſtand how to judge. For there is indeed a little ſtream under this in the Plain: But it runs ſo ſlow, that I could not well determine which way it did run. But I judged, it might run into the Gulph of <hi>Lepanto</hi> by <hi>Sant Baſilio.</hi> But whether ſome part of it runs not alſo towards the <hi>Euripus</hi> by reaſon of the level of the Plain, I cannot poſitively determine: eſpecially conſidering, that not very far from hence we croſs'd a ſtream that run from this Way-wards thither, as I before have ſhewed, and is undoubtedly the <hi>Aſopus. Hirria,</hi> or <hi>Hyſſia,</hi> being but a ſmall Town, and <hi>Plataea</hi> a large City, and ſometimes a <hi>Free State</hi> of it ſelf, I rather believe this was the <hi>Plataea;</hi> and <hi>Hyſſia</hi> another place I paſt by a little further off, nearer the way into <hi>Attica</hi> and <hi>Megara.</hi> The Plain under this Mountain undoubtedly was the Plain of <hi>Plataea,</hi> famous for the Battle and Victory of the <hi>Greeks</hi> over the <hi>Perſians, Mardonius</hi> being then General of <hi>Xerxes</hi> his Army.</p>
               <p>Hence proceeding about a Mile we endeavoured to get over the Mountain; but finding no Tract in the Snow, and that it was too deep to be paſſed over, we left that way, and deſcending again into the Plain, we went further Eaſtwards,<note place="margin">PIGADIA.</note> and came to a ſmall Village called <hi>Pigadia;</hi> whence, having ſtayed and refreſhed our ſelves, we took Horſe, and made again towards the Mountain, quickly gaining the way from <hi>Thebes</hi> into the <hi>Morea;</hi> and afterwards that from <hi>Egripo</hi> thither alſo: where we again went up the <hi>Cithaeron,</hi> or <hi>Elatea,</hi> as it is now vulgarly called, from the abundance of <hi>Firr Trees</hi> growing thereon, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſtill call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. We aſcended it by the way now called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>The way of the Vizire;</hi> for it was he commanded it to be opened, made ſmooth, and covered with Sand, when he paſſed that way with his Army into the <hi>Morea,</hi> and thence into <hi>Candia,</hi> at the beginning of that War. We arrived to the top from the foot in an hours time, and deſcended as ſoon into a Valley, between <hi>Cithaeron</hi> and the Mountain called now <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criplais.</hi> This Valley belonged in very ancient times to the <hi>Eleutherians;</hi> who being ſubject to thoſe of <hi>Thebes,</hi> out of an inveterated hatred and emulation revolted from them and join'd themſelves to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> as was pretended out of a great fancy and good affection they took to their way of Government. From thence forward this Mount <hi>Cithaeron</hi> was accounted the Confines of <hi>Attica</hi> towards <hi>Boeotia:</hi> whereas before the <hi>Eleutherians</hi> were the Borderers of <hi>Boeotia</hi> towards <hi>Attica.</hi> This Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley I find no where deſcrib'd by our modern <hi>Geographers;</hi> from which only their ignorance of it can excuſe them. For neither for its Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor its ſmallneſs, could it merit their neglect. For I believe it wants not much of being as big as the Plain of <hi>Eleuſis:</hi> I am ſure it is as long, or longer, and wants little of being as large from the foot of Mount <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latea</hi> to <hi>Macriplais,</hi> parting it from the Plains of <hi>Eleuſis</hi> and <hi>Megaris</hi> Southwards. There is one ſtream here that runneth down into the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian</hi>
                  <pb n="475" facs="tcp:95495:206"/>Gulph, or rather into that Bay of it called <hi>Livadoſtro:</hi> another that runneth the contrary way into the Plain of <hi>Eleuſis,</hi> and joins it ſelf with the <hi>Cephiſus</hi> in that Plain. There are four Villages alſo pertaining to this Valley; that is to ſay, <hi>Caſſiotica, Calivia, Ta Zeugaria,</hi> and <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phani:</hi> to which laſt we came in the Evening.</p>
               <p>Where the ancient City <hi>Eleutherus</hi> was, I could no where find; though <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſaith, the ruins of it were towards the foot of Mount <hi>Cithaeron</hi> in his time. Some ruins of Towns I ſaw. Firſt, deſcending the Mount <hi>Cithaeron,</hi> I ſaw at the left hand the Walls of a Town, which I believe was the <hi>Dryma</hi> of the ancients; and the next day, on our way, at the right hand, near the Mountain <hi>Macriplais,</hi> an old Tower, about which are the ruins of a Town; and laſtly, about an hours riding from thence, in our deſcent towards the Plain of <hi>Eleuſis,</hi> along the Torrent I before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, there were more Ruins, and a <hi>Baſſo relievo,</hi> by a little old Church. Hence we deſcended a ſteep Hill, covered with Pines, into the Plain of <hi>Eleuſis;</hi> and ſo the ſecond time to <hi>Athens.</hi> What I did and ſaw then there, I have already given an account; and therefore ſhall now only let you know, that I ſtaid there till the third of <hi>April:</hi> and then taking my final leave of it, I return'd by the ſame way, by the <hi>Eleutherians,</hi> and ſo again over Mount <hi>Cithaeron</hi> into <hi>Boeotia.</hi> But it being now better weather than it was at firſt, I muſt not forget to tell you the proſpect I had at this time, from that Mountain into <hi>Boeotia.</hi> For being got to the higheſt place of the Mountain in our Road, and having left the way of <hi>Thebes</hi> and <hi>Egripo</hi> on our right hand, and taken the way of <hi>Romelia,</hi> lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards <hi>Rimocaſtri, Zaitori, Lariſſa</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> I ſtopt at the firſt advantagious place for a Proſpect; where theſe ways part was called by the ancients <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or, the <hi>Three Heads,</hi> ſignifying I ſuppoſe the ſame we do by <hi>Three Wents:</hi> From the brow of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain I had a very fair proſpect down into the ſeveral Plains of <hi>Boeotia,</hi> comprehending the Northern half of the Compaſs. Under this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain therefore is firſt the Plain of <hi>Platea;</hi> North of that the Plain of <hi>Theſpia,</hi> divided from <hi>Platea</hi> by one or two Ridges of Hills, coming from that Hill which is between the <hi>Helicon</hi> and <hi>Cithaeron,</hi> or between <hi>Liva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſtro</hi> and <hi>Cacos.</hi> Beyond this are the Plains of <hi>Livadia</hi> and <hi>Thebes;</hi> both of them bounded from <hi>Theſpia,</hi> by a Ridge coming from the <hi>Helicon;</hi> which paſſing by <hi>Panagia,</hi> and <hi>Rimocaſtri, &amp;c.</hi> reacheth almoſt to <hi>Thebes.</hi> The Plains of <hi>Livadia</hi> and <hi>Thebes</hi> are ſeparated from each other by the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Phaenicius</hi> or <hi>Sphinx.</hi> Beyond <hi>Thebes</hi> North-Eaſt is the <hi>Campus Ionius,</hi> under Mount <hi>Hypatus,</hi> and <hi>Campus Tanagricus</hi> South of it. Thence, South of that, is the Plain called <hi>Paraſcopia,</hi> even to under the Eaſtern Ridge of Mount <hi>Cithaeron</hi> and <hi>Parnes:</hi> ſo that <hi>Paraſcopia</hi> lyeth Eaſtwards parallel with the <hi>Plataeenſes, Tanagricus</hi> to that of <hi>Theſpia,</hi> and <hi>Ionius</hi> to the <hi>Theban</hi> Plain Eaſt, and the Plain of <hi>Livadia</hi> Weſt and North-Weſt. The Mountain <hi>Cocino</hi> and <hi>Mezeraci</hi> above <hi>Hylica palus</hi> lies juſt North beyond the <hi>Theban</hi> Plain. The Hill bounding the Plain of <hi>Thebes</hi> and <hi>Livadia,</hi> North-North-Weſt. <hi>Panagia</hi> being a ruined Tower and Town upon a pointed Rock on the Hill of <hi>Rimocaſtri,</hi> and not above three or four Miles Weſtwards of that Town lyeth North-Weſt. In the ſame line, beyond the Plain of <hi>Livadia,</hi> is the higheſt point of <hi>Lycoria,</hi> or <hi>Parnaſſus.</hi> The higheſt point of the <hi>Helicon,</hi> now <hi>Zagara,</hi> Weſt-North-Weſt. <hi>Macriplais,</hi> the Mountain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:95495:207"/>the Plain of <hi>Eleutherus,</hi> and the Plains of <hi>Eleuſis</hi> and <hi>Megara,</hi> South-Eaſt, <hi>Nozea</hi> and <hi>Caſha,</hi> in old times <hi>Parnes</hi> and <hi>Lycabettus</hi> Eaſt.</p>
               <p>When I had taken my fill of this proſpect we deſcended again into the Plain, paſſing by the Ruins of <hi>Hyſſia,</hi> near the foot of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, about a Mile further by <hi>Plataea:</hi> and a little further down into the Plain we ſtaid to bait, near the ſmall ſtream I before mention'd: where I now obſerved abundance of <hi>Narciſſus</hi> growing along its Banks; and ſhot a <hi>Lapwing</hi> or <hi>Pewit,</hi> with ſharp Spurs on the Wings, as <hi>Cocks</hi> and <hi>Pheaſants</hi> have on their Legs: of which I obſerved ſomething at <hi>Smyrna</hi> on Ducks. Thence we paſſed over ſome Hills, and arrived at <hi>Rimocaſtri</hi> an hour before Night, the ſecond day of our departure from <hi>Athens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next day we parted from <hi>Rimocastri,</hi> keeping along the Hill it ſtands on, towards <hi>Livadia,</hi> and came to an old Ruined Tower, with the remains of a Town about it, ſeated upon a high point of a Rock, part of ſome Hill,<note place="margin">PANAGIA.</note> called now only <hi>Panagia:</hi> which is the ſame, that I ſaid lay North-Weſt from the Paſſage over Mount <hi>Cithaeron.</hi> It over-looketh the Plain of <hi>Theſpia</hi> South, and the Plain of <hi>Livadia</hi> North; and is not above a Mile from <hi>Neo-coria,</hi> or <hi>Theſpia</hi> South. Between both is a little Valley, which hath a ſtream running thorough it, by the Plain of <hi>Theſpia,</hi> into the Gulph or Bay of <hi>Livadoſtro.</hi> This I ſuppoſe was the River <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſſus;</hi> which <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſaith, <hi>floweth about the Helicon,</hi> as this doth a good part of it.<note place="margin">CERESSUS.</note> This place is alſo moſt likely to be that <hi>Cereſſus</hi> he ſpeaks of, ſaying, it was a <hi>very strong castle of the Theſpians,</hi> and whither they fled upon every occaſion when they fear'd the coming of the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> amongſt them. Here in ſeveral Ruined Churches I met with ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions: one eſpecially of ſuch odd Characters, and different from the ordinary, that I cannot but queſtion whether it were ſo very ancient or no. Another upon half a large Pedeſtal of a Statue: of which Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I was able to read ſo much, as ſhewed it to have been dedicated to the Emperour <hi>Commodus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here I was overtaken by a Meſſenger from the Engliſh <hi>Conſul</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> to let me know, there was an Engliſh Ship arrived thither; whereby I might have convenience to ſend my Marbles, and whatever I would elſe, into <hi>England:</hi> which alſo in its return was to touch at <hi>Zant,</hi> whither I was bound. Theſe Letters invited me very earneſtly to return again thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But I was not willing to go ſo far back again; thinking it more ſafe to go by Boat to <hi>Zant,</hi> the ſame way I came; we having then War with <hi>Tripoli,</hi> and the Ship at <hi>Athens</hi> had no Convoy to guard it.

               </p>
               <p>After Dinner I parted again from <hi>Rimocaſtri,</hi> and paſſed along that Hill towards the Plain of <hi>Livadia,</hi> leaving the way to <hi>Panagia</hi> on our left hand: not far beyond which I paſſed over a Torrent, coming down from the <hi>Helicon</hi> with a great Stream: and near where I paſſed it, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd ſeveral Springs, with very plentiful Sources of Water. This may be that Stream which was anciently called <hi>Permeſſus;</hi> which deſcended from the <hi>Helicon,</hi> and together with <hi>Olmeus</hi> falls into the Lake <hi>Copais,</hi> by <hi>Haliartus,</hi> as <hi>Strabo,</hi> in his Ninth Book informs us. After I had forded this Stream, I paſs'd over the Hill into the Plain of <hi>Livadia:</hi> where lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

Thence, this Hill turning South Weſtwards towards the <hi>Helicon,</hi> and joining with it enlargeth the Plain of <hi>Livadia,</hi> to the foot of that Mountain: whence it is again ſtreightened by another lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Mountain, ſtretched out towards <hi>Livadia:</hi> So that were this whole Plain filled with Water, this would be a conſiderable Bay of the Lake <hi>Livadia:</hi> This I judge to be the chief part of the Plain, called from the City <hi>Coronaea, Coronaei ager;</hi> which City without doubt was ſituated in ſome eminent place of this Plain near the <hi>Helicon:</hi> But where, I am not certain. I ſuppoſe it was either at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Georgio,</hi> which is at the foot of the <hi>Helicon,</hi> or at certain Ruins of a Tower I paſſed by the next day, going that way, or at leaſt at the Ruins of <hi>Dyminia,</hi> in the way from <hi>Livadia</hi> to <hi>Thebes.</hi> As to the nearneſs to the <hi>Helicon,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Georgio</hi> ſeemeth to agree better with it than either <hi>Dyminia,</hi> or that Tower between them. But the Stream, which ſhould be <hi>Coralius,</hi> riſing at <hi>Dyminia,</hi> ſhews it rather to be there that it was ſituated. The forty <hi>Stadia,</hi> or five Miles, from Mount <hi>Libethrius,</hi> and twenty <hi>Stadia,</hi> or two Miles and a half, from <hi>Laphytius,</hi> ſeem to ſhew, that <hi>Libethrius</hi> Mountain was that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Panagia</hi> and <hi>Rimocaſtri;</hi> and that one of thoſe towards <hi>Livadia,</hi> was <hi>Laphytius.</hi> But whether that agrees beſt to <hi>Dyminia,</hi> the <hi>Tower,</hi> or S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Georgio,</hi> I cannot well determine. And indeed the Deſcriptions of the ancients are ſo defective for want of aſſigning the quarters of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens to them, that it is very hard for us that come ſo long after them, to determine poſitively the true ſituation of their places: and ſometimes impoſſible.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Dyminia</hi> was formerly <hi>Coronea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">MINERVA ITONIA.</note> then the Ruined Tower may have been the place where the Temple of <hi>Minerva Itonia</hi> ſometimes ſtood: which was the place where all <hi>Boeotia</hi> uſed to aſſemble in Council.</p>
               <p>Thence coming nearer to the foot of the <hi>Helicon,</hi> I paſſed by a very pleaſant Proſpect into a little Plain, incloſed every way with prominent parts of the Mountain; except one narrow Paſſage for entrance to it like to a Sea-Port. Hence we ſoon mounted up to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Georgio,</hi> ſituate on the ſide of <hi>Helicon,</hi> having left a Village below it on the right hand. Either S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Georgio,</hi> or this Village was probably the <hi>Alalcontenae</hi> of old time. This Town is called <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>George,</hi> from a Monaſtery there dedicated to him. There are two or three Churches here in which are ſome Inſcriptions of Antiquity: But I could not ſee them, becauſe my Guide was afraid of the Turks; and my <hi>Druggerman</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to <hi>Athens,</hi> to give the Conſul an account of my Reſolutions to proceed on my Voyage to <hi>Zant.</hi> So we ſtaid not long in this place, but mounted up a conſiderable way higher, toward the top of the <hi>Helicon;</hi> with intentions to paſs quite over it, unto the Convent of <hi>Saint Luke:</hi> But we were hindred by the Snow; which was not yet paſſable.</p>
               <p>This Mountain is now called <hi>Zagara</hi> by the Turks,<note place="margin">M. ZAGARA the HELICON.</note> from the great abundance of Hares they ſay breed there; although there be plenty of other Game alſo, eſpecially Wild Boars and Dear: But it is known out of <hi>Strabo</hi> undoubtedly to be that famous <hi>Helicon</hi> of the ancients. For, agreeable to his Deſcription, it lyeth upon the <hi>Criſſean,</hi> or <hi>Corinthian</hi> Gulph, bordering upon <hi>Phocis;</hi> which it regards Northward, ſomewhat
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:95495:208"/>inclining to the Weſt. And as the ſaith, its high Cliffs hang over the laſt Harbour of <hi>Phocis;</hi> which was therefore called <hi>Mycus:</hi> nor is it not far diſtant from <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> nor inferiour to it, either in height, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of ground that it ſtands on. Finally, that they are both Rocky Mountains, and the tops of them perpetually covered with Snow. Mount <hi>Helicon</hi> was in old times conſecrated to the Muſes by the <hi>Thracians;</hi> and was the native Country of the ancient Poet <hi>Heſiod,</hi> who was born at <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra,</hi> an inhoſpitable Town on the ſide of it towards the Sea; whom <hi>Ovid</hi> ſeems to follow and imitate, but with more briskneſs and leſs gravity. <hi>Heſiod</hi> ſeems with more reſpect to celebrate the Gods, as it became his perſwaſion of them, and with more earneſtneſs to preſs men to Juſtice, Vertue and Humanity: which is as much to be preferred before the others bawdy and lying ſtories of them, as all Moral and Chriſtian Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues infinitely tranſcend the obſcene Lampoons of our preſent Age, being really more beautiful and attracting Objects than any Miſtreſſes in the World. I found not thoſe Monuments, either of <hi>Heſiod, Orpheus,</hi> or <hi>the Muſes, Pauſanias</hi> in his time profeſſeth to have ſeen there: And as to the Fountain <hi>Hippocrene,</hi> the famous haunt of the nine Siſters, it was then frozen up, if it were where I gueſs'd it to have been. So that were I a Poet, and never ſo great a Votary of thoſe <hi>Heliconian Deities,</hi> I might be excuſed from making Verſes in their praiſe, having neither their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to excite, nor their liquor to inſpire me. For having gone two or three Miles forwards on the top, till I came to the Snow, my further proceedings that way were hindred; only alighting I made ſhift to clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber up the Rocks ſomewhat higher, until I came to look down into a place encompaſſed round with the tops of Mountains; ſo that the inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſpace ſeemed to me to be a Lake frozen, and covered with Snow. But my Guide telling me be paſſed that way once in the Summer time with <hi>Monſieur Nantueil,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſador, and then ſaw it a very pleaſant green Valley, covered with Flowers, having a very good Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the middle of it; I am much inclin'd to think the <hi>Hippocrene</hi> was there, and there alſo in antient times the delicious Grove of the Muſes.</p>
               <p>I obſerved likewiſe great ſtore of the <hi>Male-Fir-Tree</hi> growing on this Mountain; whoſe Turpentine is very fragrant, much reſembling the ſmell of a Nutmeg, and ſome of that <hi>Leopards-bane,</hi> whoſe root is like a Scorpion. But her partly the cold of a backward Spring, and partly the time of Year, hindred me from making any further diſcoveries in that kind. I ſhall only tell you what <hi>Pauſanias</hi> telleth me, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is one kind of an <hi>Arbutus,</hi> or Strawberry-Tree, beareth ſweeter fruit here than in any other place he knows: which may well be, although I took no notice of any there. I ſaw here alſo a very large Tortoiſe, newly come out of ground, to enjoy the warm Sun; and of which they ſay there is great plenty bred there.</p>
               <p>We return'd to the brow of the Mountain by the ſame way we came, and thence I had a fair and large Proſpect of the Plains of <hi>Boeotia</hi> North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and obſerved the Mountain <hi>Delphi</hi> of <hi>Egripo</hi> to lie exactly Eaſt of us, and another of the ſame Iſland to lie Eaſt-North-Eaſt. We left the way to St. <hi>Georgio,</hi> and turning to our left hand, deſcended into a Plain, between the Mountain <hi>Helicon,</hi> and another little Mountain; the Eaſtern end of which comes up near to it, and the Town of St. <hi>George,</hi>
                  <pb n="479" facs="tcp:95495:208"/>but thence runs North-Weſtwards, beyond <hi>Livadia,</hi> which it hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it on the North-ſide. This Mountain from the Plain of <hi>Boeotia,</hi> ſeems not at all diſtinct from the <hi>Helicon;</hi> although it hath a Plain between it, and that in ſome places I believe three or four Miles wide. On the top of it, on the Eaſt end, we ſaw <hi>Granitza,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">GRANITZA.</note> which I was told was a Town and Biſhoprick under the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Athens.</hi> Here is alſo a Convent of <hi>Caloires,</hi> or <hi>Greekiſh</hi> Monks: which is all I could learn of the place; only from the ancients I gather that this Mountain was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by two diſtinct names; to wit, <hi>Laphytius</hi> on this end,<note place="margin">LAPHYTIUS and TELPHY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIUM, mm.</note> and <hi>Telphyſium</hi> on the Weſtern. In deſcending we turned ſtill round the <hi>Helicon</hi> to our left hand; and in our way paſſed by many Fountains that iſſue out of the ſides of that Mountain; ſome of which run down into the Plain of <hi>Livadia,</hi> as far as the Lake, into which they flow: others collect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a Stream in this Valley, One makes a fine Caſcade almoſt from the top of the Mountain, and I believe runneth from the Lake, I before ſpake of, on the top of the <hi>Helicon,</hi> by its nearneſs to that place. There was abundance of the <hi>Narciſſus</hi> Flowers growing along the Banks of this Stream, ſo <hi>proliferous,</hi> that I had not before ſeen any the like; having ſeven, eight, nine, ſometimes ten Flowers upon the ſame ſtalk, and very fragrant. Here my Guide proved to be near as ignorant and unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Country as my ſelf; and it growing towards Night, we knew not whither to go to Lodge. A Village we ſaw two or three Miles high, on the Precipices of the <hi>Helicon;</hi> but how to get to it we knew not. At laſt, ſenſible of the diſtreſs we were in, and almoſt out of hopes of getting any ſhelter but the Heavens that Night; by the good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God we over-took two or three Oxen, which we followed as <hi>Cadmus</hi> did a Heifer, by direction of the Oracle to the Building of <hi>Thebes:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ovid. Met. <hi>L. 3.</hi>
                  </note> Theſe brought us to a Shepherds Hutt; which we found to be too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to hold us and the Cattle together. But the Shepherd inform'd us, there was a Village about two Miles further, which having found with much ado, by that time it was dark, being ſeated upon a little Hill, juſt under the <hi>Helicon,</hi> we were received courteouſly into the Houſe of a good honeſt <hi>Albaneſe,</hi> the only Inhabitant at preſent of the place, the reſt of the Inhabitants were all run away, not being able to pay their <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratch.</hi> Here is an old Church, with ſome remains of Antiquity about it. But I cannot conjecture the ancient name of the place, unleſs it ſhould have been <hi>Atalcomenae,</hi> which <hi>Strabo</hi> ſeems to intimate, ſpeaking of the <hi>Telphyſium mons,</hi> which he placeth between <hi>Halyartus, Atalcomenae,</hi> and <hi>Coronea. Halyartus</hi> was near the Lake <hi>Copais,</hi> and as <hi>Pauſanias</hi> reports, fifty <hi>Stadia,</hi> or ſix Miles, from this Mountain. But if this Village were the <hi>Atalcomenae</hi> of old, then the River that cometh this way out of the <hi>Helicon,</hi> ſhould be that of <hi>Triton</hi> which paſſed by <hi>Atalcomenae;</hi> and not the other riſing between <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> and <hi>Cyrphis,</hi> I before ſpoke of. All the entertainment we found here was the ſad ſtories our Landlord told us of the Oppreſſion they ſuffer by their hard Maſters the Turks. My Guide made me take notice, that his Daughter did wear red Slippers, which was a ſign ſhe intended to be Married, when ſhe could get her a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; which I gueſs ſhe could not long have wanted, had not the Town been ſo much depopulated; for natural Beauty was ſuch as might
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:95495:209"/>make her deſerve the Courtſhip of the braveſt Shepherd of the <hi>Boeotian</hi> Plains.</p>
               <p>The next Morning we parted thence, and keeping ſtill under the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licon</hi> on our left hand, in a very rotten, unſound way: I obſerved almoſt every ſtep our Horſes made, there ſprung up a new <hi>Hippocrene;</hi> the freſh Water following each print of my Horſes feet; eſpecially at one place, where I was almoſt ſtuck faſt, although the ſurface of the ground was covered with a green Sword. Theſe Springs collect themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the other River in this Valley, and I believe paſs under ground to <hi>Livadia,</hi> and make the River <hi>Hercyna,</hi> when they ariſe there. For I know not which way otherwiſe they can paſs: and the abundance of Water, which there ariſeth again, confirmeth me in that opinion. Here the <hi>Helicon</hi> makes an Elbow Northward, almoſt joining with that of <hi>Granitza</hi> and <hi>Livadia</hi> in the way, to which from <hi>Salona</hi> and <hi>Delphos</hi> we came in about half an hours further riding: So ſoon as we were got into that way, we met with a <hi>Caratchi;</hi> a formidable Officer of the Turks among the Greeks, being the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> Collector of Taxes. So con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing ſtill our winding about the foot of this Mountain, and leaving the way to <hi>Delphos</hi> on our right hand, we arrived at the Convent of <hi>Saint Luca:</hi> of which and the Hermitage I ſaw there, when we came firſt into theſe parts, I have elſewhere already given an account. So that I have only now to tell you of my return thence; and ſo conclude.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>April</hi> the tenth I ſent a Meſſenger from hence to the Port of <hi>Aſproſpiti,</hi> to ſee whether any Barks lay there, bound for <hi>Zant:</hi> and word being brought me that there were two, I prevailed with the <hi>Egoumeno</hi> of the Convent, to let <hi>Pappa Carito,</hi> one of the <hi>Religious men,</hi> accompany me thither. So after Dinner I parted thence, and paſſed over the Plain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> and <hi>Helicon,</hi> by the way to <hi>Delphos;</hi> which I left, after an hour and halfs riding, on the right hand, and paſſing by <hi>Aſproſpiti</hi> in the Evening, we came to Bay of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Gulph, called by the ſame name, by that time it was dark.</p>
               <p>The next Morning we Embarked in the Calm, but were met preſently with a contrary Wind and ſudden ſtorm in the middle of the Bay: So that not without much danger, we were forced to return again into the ſame Port. It was a ſtrange and almoſt aſtoniſhing ſight for us to ſee the Storm come upon us at three or four Miles diſtance, while we were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calm'd, yet on the ſudden to fall on us with ſuch a fury, as if it would immediately ſwallow us up, being accompanied with ſuch a prodigious Rain and Hail, as we fear'd would fill all the vacant places in the Bark, that the Wheat, wherewith it was full laden, did not employ. But ſo ſoon as we were again got on ſhore, it immediately grew as fair weather as ever it was. But the Sun continuing again to ſhine, and the Marriners reſolving to ſtay a while in the Port, and ſee the weather bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſetled, I gave order to the men to make ſome further Proviſions for us, while I went to divert my ſelf upon the Rocks hard by; partly with the pleaſure of a good proſpect from thence into the Gulph, and partly by ſearching what Plants nature might be found there to produce.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, I found this Bay of <hi>Aſproſpiti</hi> a very large Bay, and this Rock to be a <hi>Peninſula</hi> at the bottom of it, of about three Miles
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:95495:209"/>compaſs; making a good Harbour on each ſide of the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of it: Its Weſtern Promontory being <hi>Mons Cyrphis;</hi> now called <hi>Stiva.</hi> Its Eaſtern Promontory, is made by certain Rocks deſcending from the Mountains about <hi>Saint Luca Striotes,</hi> and the <hi>Helicon:</hi> and I believe 'twas anciently called <hi>Plarigum Promontorium.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">PHARIGIUM PROM. ANTICYR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RHA. MARATHON.</note> For this Bay was certainly that which in older time was called <hi>Anticyrrha;</hi> and perhaps the old Town of that name might be upon this <hi>Peninſula:</hi> for I ſaw ſome Ruins there. Not far from <hi>Anticyrrha</hi> was alſo a Town of <hi>Phocis</hi> called <hi>Marathon;</hi> which, as I alſo conjecture, may have been the preſent Village of <hi>Aſproſpiti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor was this all my Divertiſement. For I found in clambering up thoſe Rocks, one of the moſt pretty natural Grots I ever ſaw. It ſeem'd to be made on purpoſe for the habitation of ſome Hermite. The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance was but ſmall: But within was a very pretty room, receiving light by a hole in the rock above; and on the left hand about a mans height from the ground, is a place that lookt like the old <hi>Hermits</hi> Bed-Chamber; whoever he was. For that ſome ſuch Religious man did once live there, the aptitude of the place would not ſuffer me to doubt. Here, within this Hermites place, I repoſed my ſelf awhile; and afterwards the weather continuing ſtill fair, I went abroad, and found very many curious Plants growing upon thoſe Rocks; which were a ſecond Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement to me, nothing leſs agreeable than the firſt. I ſpecifie ſuch only here, as I have not taken notice of elſewhere: and of thoſe theſe that follow are the chief.</p>
               <p>A kind of <hi>Syderitis,</hi> with a tuft of Blue leaves, like <hi>Horminum Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another ſort, which from a long tough root hath many thick, hoary, roundiſh, and ſcaloped Leaves, reſembling the <hi>Lamiums;</hi> out of which runs a round. creeping, downy ſtem of a reddiſh colour, beſet one above another with bluiſh Flowers, not divided into Leaves, but whole, till near the top, much reſembling <hi>Trachelion;</hi> but ſcarce ſo much open, and much leſs. It hath been taken for <hi>Scutellaria:</hi> but I find it not to agree with <hi>Bauhinus</hi> his Deſcription of that Plant.</p>
               <p>A very ſmall ſort, or kind, of <hi>Eryngium:</hi> which I take to be that which <hi>Johnſon</hi> calls <hi>Eryngium Pucillum, Planum;</hi> only he deſcribes it much bigger than it groweth here; which may well be, by reaſon of the ſtonineſs and ſterility of the Rocks of this place.</p>
               <p>When I returned to the Bark, I found them ready to depart, and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only for me. I therefore immediately return'd to Sea; and in a ſhort time doubled the <hi>Cape,</hi> or Weſtern Promontory of the Bay, called by them <hi>Tramachi ſto Criſſa, The Cape to Criſſa,</hi> and came and ſtayed that Night at <hi>Pendhagi,</hi> where we arrived alſo, when we firſt came into <hi>Greece.</hi> The next Morning we were ſoon out of the Bay of <hi>Criſſa,</hi> or. <hi>Salona,</hi> and doubled the Weſtern <hi>Cape</hi> of it; which they call Ψ<gap reason="foreign">

It is only of thoſe parts of <hi>Greece</hi> I have ſurveyed my ſelf, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the greateſt part of <hi>Achaia.</hi> I have made it my care to be exact in placing the Mountains, Promontories, Bayes, Rivers and Lakes accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their natural ſituation. Of which only I have given the antient names with the modern: as to the Towns I have given only the modern names, having a deſign to give the ancient names of them in a Treatiſe by themſelves, if I find it worth my pains.</p>
               <p>The Night being come, and a brisk Gale with it, blowing out of the Gulph, we ſet Sail, and about ten of the Clock we paſſed between both the Caſtles unſeen by the Turks: But not without very great apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that we ſhould have ſome great ſhot let fly after us. But Heavens, that had ſo many times wonderfully preſerved me, did then alſo deliver me out of the hands of thoſe Infidels, and brought me ſafely to <hi>Zant</hi> the next day by Noon. Whence by the firſt occaſion I departed for <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France:</hi> where having further ſatisfied my curioſity, and congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated with my Friends my proſperous Voyage, I haſted to render my ſelf to my Country, and to the long-wiſh'd-for Embraces of my Parents, Relations and Friends, and to give Praiſe to God for the <hi>Wonderful things he had done for my Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That he had placed the Lot of mine Inheritance in a Land that he had bleſſed, and hedged about for himſelf: where nothing is wanting to ſupply the defects of frail nature; but where Peace and Plenty for this many Years have ſeem'd to embrace each other; where every Mans Right, from the Prince to the Peaſant, is ſecured to him by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of good and wholeſome Laws; And more, by a King who is the Indulgent Father of his Country, and not a Tyrant: and laſtly, rendred me into the Boſom of a Church, that I had often heard, but now knew, to be the moſt refined, pure, and Orthodox Church in the World; freed from Slavery, Errour and Superſtition, and without Novelty or Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, eſtabliſhed in Purity of Doctrine, Decency and Order.</p>
               <p>Therefore arriving at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> its Metropolitan Throne, <hi>November</hi> the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1676. tranſported with unſpeakable Joy at the ſingular Bliſs of my Country, Relations and Friends, far exceeding any Nation I had ſeen beyond our Brittiſh Seas, I offered to God the Sacrifice of Praiſe and Thankſgiving, reſolving for ever to call upon his Great Name, who is
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:95495:210" rendition="simple:additions"/>the only mighty Preſerver of Mankind. Whoſe Providence encompaſſeth all his Creatures, and who never faileth thoſe that truſt in him. Saying with the Pſalmiſt,</p>

                  <p>Praiſe the Lord O my Soul, whilſt I live will I praiſe the Lord; yea as long as I have any Being, I will ſing Praiſes unto my God, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.</p>
                  <p>Glory to God in the Higheſt! on Earth Peace, and good will towards men.</p>
                  <p>Glory be to him that ſitteth on the Throne; and to the Lamb for evermore.</p>
                  <p>Glory be to the Holy of Holies; and to the Promiſed comforter abiding with us for ever.</p>
                  <p>For He is Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End, the Author and Finiſher of us, and all our Works. Therefore to him only let Prayers ever be made, and daily let him be praiſed. For to him only belongeth Praiſe, Glory, Power, Might, Majeſty, and Dominion for ever and ever, World without End, <hi>Amen.</hi>
